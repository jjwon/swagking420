Man I've been on the grind
1 in the head, 16 in the nine, I'm extra man
The game is mine in due time
It's alright I'm patient man
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I've done some dumb things, but for the most I've played it smart
Who cares if you run things? Cause I'm as live as 106 &amp; Park
This game is nothing but a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive; It's do or die get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back, go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man, I'll die for my peoples
Everybody knows it's the truth
That why they respect everything that I do, everywhere that I go
Every friend, every foe, every bitch, every ho
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X, from the X to the blow
Mark my words, I'm next to blow
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B To the U, Double the L
Me, Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples that's locked up in jail
Ima succeed, I'm never gon fail
Papojust watch me

Uncle Luke that man did coach me
He taught me the who, what, wheres and whys
How to cross T's, How to dot I's
Little did he know he created a monster
Pitbull nigga I'm that monster
D.B. them chicos is monsters
Lil' Jon that nigga's a monster
Everybody in the clique is well equipped
Ready for Pit to take over shit
This here is not a game, this here is our lives
We can't fuck this up, we gotta get it right
If you with us and you ready for war then lets ride
Lets show how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in their house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth
Follow me now, all these bitches wanna swallow me now
All these niggas that I don't even know wanna holla at me now cause they wanna be down but fuck'em man
Me, I'mma turn it up a notch
To my hustlers be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas be careful when you burnin up the Glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops
Pit's gon take it from the bottom to the top
Haters can hate but it ain't gon stop
Everybody knows I'mma blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock


[Hook: Lil'Jon]
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique

(Chorus)
Haters in the club (back up)
Gold Diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 1)
I'm in the cut in the club
Scopin the scene
Cup half way full
Smokin the green
She got her hand on my nuts
What does that mean?
Pointed at her freind
And she said, they'll tag team
Now who said dreams dont come true
Its like I'm dreamin
When I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mike mami
Mic check one two
Drunk in the club
Off the chain
But who gives as fuck?
That's why I came
So pour it up
And get down
Ya'll have no choice
But to listen to Pit now

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 2)
Everybody knows
Pit's got tight raps
When I'm in the club
DJs bring it back
With no questions asked
But the number one question is
"Does he got cash?"
Lil Jon's at the bar
While me and them eastside boys smoke out
Roll another one
No doubt
Get a couple hoes
Roll out
Beef, you dont want none
To go down
Dum diddy dum dum
My times now
The city Im from
Is covered with federals
That'll make your crew run run
Your crew run run
Its next to come

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

(Verse 3)
I convince mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head spinning
Like some sprewells
Skip the details
Its the vodka bottom line
Thats testin my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
Or those chains or that ice or them cars
All thats bullshit
If thats what your lookin for
Keep lookin ho
Cause you got the wrong one bitch
I'll let you know
Mami's like damn
That Cuban's shot out
Bitch I came to the club
To wild out
If you came to act up
Then you need to get from me bitch
And back up

(Chorus)
Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Put your ass in reverse baby (back up)
It dont involve money then (back up)
Dawg, get from me and (back up)
Everytime I fall I get right (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)
Gold diggers (back up)
Broke niggas (back up)
I suggest, I suggest that you (back up)

Haters in the club (back up)

With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie

Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker
Won't cha
Give credit where credit is due don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time

Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

Ohhh baby, my sweet baby

It's a sight to see her shake her ass (Drop it low)
Fresh to death, I'm polo and we are
In the middle of the floor


Don't dance no more

In ATL

And all these shawties

I'm like, "Nigga, you trippin'"

So much booty, she could supply the demand
I wanna take that big ‘ol booty shopping at the mall
I wanna pick it up and put that booty in my car
Baby your booty is a movie star
Oscar award winner of them all
Now give me that


Mesmerized by the size of it
You can fight it if you like take your time

Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up, dawg
Struggle, hustle, fight hard, that's all I know, that's right, dawg
Blood of a king, heart of a lion (heart of a lion)
Based on rental, pussy boy
Someone please pass me the iron
Death before dishonor
That means for years I've been dyin'
Stop your blood clots cryin'
I'm here to save Private Ryan

[Bridge]


[Hook]



Can't stop me now

Hey mira, yo tengo una fantasia con charitin
Y solo con pensar tengo que apagar…
From the Bronx like Jennifer Lopez
Pero en verdad prefiero a Selena Gomez
Que lo que tu comes, y te lo comen
Como tu te pones, loco tu me pones
Con esos majones y esos melones pe ponen…
I wanna..it, I wanna get upon it
Yo me quito los pantalones y le hago trrr
En la mañana morning sigo contigo y…
La vida high, empieza el caballo…

So you try to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand


[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'd sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers
I try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart
But my blood's filled with demons, I'm fighting myself, hah
Believe me I'm far from lingering, far from readyif you
Knew where I come from, knew what I've been through
You'd think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids a father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they'll X you like malcolm
Then you wonder how come, I can move in a room full of wolves so swift so smooth
Thank you, Mom, for making me a man
Let a motherfucker knock down my castle out of sand




[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking for the keys but they won't find them
I come from struggle, I'm a fighter, must she be reminded?
My mothers past has her trapped, has her blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strenght, I fought the game
Do or die,Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, Mom I love you, I salute ya'
And no matter what happens, just know you're the reason that I'm rapping




Look..
[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
I'm from the home of the spinners, the winners, the big apple
Came down at south beach to build a new castle
Everyday I'm hustelin' and everyday you hassle
Doin' what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and Imma' show you I'm a winna'
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show em' the big picture
Pit, hit the swich I promise I'll never switch up
This is for my brother two three who went to jail
I'm sending all the pictures of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter, said "I knew you'd never fail"
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pale
