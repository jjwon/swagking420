[Intro]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through


[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from


[Bridge x3]
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami


[Hook]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit


[Verse 2]
You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the Industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!

You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels




[Bridge x3/Hook]
[Verse 3]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn First at the light that's in front me
Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
Cause its all that I ever had


Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit...[Outro x2]
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that


[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh


[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw




[Hook: Charli XCX]
[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I’m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!


[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
And so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing,slayin' these hoes
Gold trigger on the gun like

Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre, 7
Bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre


[Verse 1: T.I.]
Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no dick if it’s a bush down there
Girl, I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
Hey, come fuck with a nigga, what better to do?
He call and ask how you doin, tell him "Better than you", yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me fucking if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well, I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it, I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz, that’s mediocre bitch!




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me? Iggs




[Hook]
[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick,she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit,what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around, give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face,ménage à veinte
20 at the same time,wanna get ya rent paid?

[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you

Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'

Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn
Stamped passports where they all pass ports
Til the clocks fast forward
There'll be dark blue shores
Where they don't do chores

Damn, this is the life
Exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand
And they landin' on top of all the mansions

Put you up in Neiman Marcus where you supposed to shop
Hey let me show you that watch
You supposed to wear,hey get up out

Tell your mom and dad that you straight
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet,
Hustle Gang on your chest,
Ain't no time for no stress

Yeah I love your hustle, baby
Just let me add a little bit of muscle, baby
Joint venture, we'll partner up until the shares are up
And I up your wages
On a private island, Dolo
One across the Cono
Them broads before me was locals
Through customs accustom your wardrobe, damn
Stamped passports where they all pass ports
Til the clocks fast forward
There'll be dark blue shores
Where they don't do chores
We just get chauffered
Damn, this is the life
Exclusive shit with all access granted
In the country where the accents are grand
And they landin' on top of all the mansions




[Hook x4]
[Verse 2: T.I.]
If you could listen more than you speak
I get you everything that you need

Hustle Gang on your chest,
Ain't no time for no stress


[Iggy Azalea]
We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors

[Hook x4]
[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could

You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money, and you ain't looking to settle down
Girl, you keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're 'round me, yeah
That's why I keep it 100, 100, 100
When you're round me, girl
When you come around me

Imma keep it 100, I'm a boss chick but he run it
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
No Michael Kors just Tom Ford
Saint Tropez, I'm like bonjour
In Spain wearing that Balmain
Lanvin, Givenchy
On the top floor of that penthouse
I got ten toes on that concrete
Keep it G with the money, I ain't gotta lie about shit
I don't need the money, I can buy my shit
Heard in the streets that he fucked that bitch
He know imma put his ass out my shit
Paid one million for that drop six
And he got the Glock in my cockpit
Them other chicks he get caught with
I'm the bitch he gonna rock with
They talk shit but we bought shit
Fly Aussie on boss shit
When he need to be, where he need to be
I tell him "go on, it ain't no thing to me"
Gotta hit that thing, bring that back witcha
Let me thumb through the check if you wanna get sexy
You knew I was high class ass when you met me
My money tall, it's too bad for y'all
Your dough as short as Joe Pesci
I'm a fancy bitch but I'm ratchet
Not like the bitch you had, ain't never had shit
Respect that,how I come around, no run around
You better humble down
Them games, ain't gonna play none
Keep it A1 since day one, yeah


You ain't the type of lady that's known to fuck around
Keep your mind on your money and you ain't looking to settle down

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Bankrolls'r'us, we got it
You know how we ride
No credit, no debit, no thanks
My clique pay cash everything we buy
See me walking by with my nose in the sky
Make you be like "Damn bitch, can't say hi?"
Then I hop in the drop and wave goodbye
As I drive through the tunnel looking like Lady Di
Why stress myself when he ain't there?
Let's see how he likes seeing me out there
You know how many dudes want me out there?
Just stop thinking about it
You got no idea
Don't try me man, you know I will
Throw this brick through your wind shield
Knife your nice new Rover Wheel
That fireplace? Your clothes in there
If I know you two in there
No asking what you doing there
Imma send my crew in there
You two gonna be ruined there
You violate, I demonstrate
Especially if I'm true to you
And when I come around I keep it 100 as usual




100, 100 as usual

You ain’t gotta do a shit but stay broke and die
While I keep making hits with these coca lines

Buying all bottles from the bar, let's pop...
Champagne,if them niggas die of thirst, man we'll buy a hearse
When the light hit the chain all you see is fireworks

[Intro: Bro Safari]
You won't believe this


[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I wanna take it to a new level
Rolex and a new bezel
Cameras flash everywhere I walk now
It even sounds like money when I talk now
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
First class when I dash
Ain't no other rappers near me
Just to get this type of paper
I might need customs to clear me
Bought some Cartiers just to see the haters clearly
Playing while i'm workin'
Ten thousand for a Birkin
You on Instagram lurkin', prayin' that we meet in person
Imma boss, you a turnin' model, shake, get it perfect
Bitch you look like Ms. Piggy
We like where the hell is Kermit?
I'm in position to kill it
Give a damn if you feel it
I was thinking about buyin' this car
You ain't in the building
Mind on my millions
Ain't got no time for no feelings
I come from the bottom baby
I need my money on ceilings
New classic,the new killa
Lookin' in gold mirrors
And feelin' like who's realer?
Wonderin' who's iller than the illest bitch alive
Find me someone, i'll be surprised
Stamps all in this passport
Shot glasses in Glasgow
Feelin' like what more could we ask for
Talkin' that shit cause i'm an asshole (uhn)
Fly as hell in this new Chanel
Pounds of [?]
I can't stand next to a basic
Cause ain't nothin' about me basic
Y'all know what I been on
Y'all know that I been on
Mass murder these beats
Kill everything that I get on
Perfect when I get my spit on
Small talk I don't trip on
Rocking that Versace
Can Iggy Iggy get a big on?

[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
Motherfuckers calling my phone
1-800-Bone
Boy, ain't you know?

So call my phone phone

Say you got that gun?
That AK-47
Bang! bang! bang!


[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Iggy got that secret service this that presidential shit
Get the busy tone when ya call my phone and my voicemail full of messages
Say you got that AK-47 well let me see you shoot it
Eat it up, beat it up boy don't bruise it
Put ya hands on it don't slip don't lose it
Bad bitches in my chat room, my chat room be poppin
Turn that chat room to a freak show when them bad bitches get topless
Put it on ustream for the whole world so the whole world can see it
Got that hotline, and it's about time for me to swap it out, I gotta re-up
They saying, "Iggy, oh, Iggy," they wanna play with that kitty
They calling, blowing my phone up, wishing they could kick it with me
The way I'm stunting I'm hurting felines, they wondering what I'm getting
A hustler charging all of you customers by the minute




I double G Y, Iggy
Who fuck with I? Not many
Well know like them four turtles
Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady
That late night call be the beddy-bye
Now tell me, who the fuck are you sleeping on?
Round trip flight where the fuck I want
Doing everything you bitches don't
Private parties on roof tops
Exclusive shit when I shoe shop
[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Other hoes just crew hop, while I'm pulling up in the new drop
1-800-Bone thug
That freak shit I put you on some
You could try all night but I won't come
(you could try all night but I won't come)
You better make sure you ready
These killer instincts is deadly
They calling two at a time, got that 3 way on my telly
My hotline always ringing, I got them specials and deals
You know my sex is a weapon, they lining up to get killed

Never caring if they peep cause the windows fog
Gotta get it when I get it, get it right, get it good

But the way you touch me, my dress come off
Drop get you rocking then the top come off

My love cost too baby, ain't nothing free
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy
Uh, but you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record
See you slippin' you trippin' just thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away
Told 'em that's a fall, try out another day
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
What you looking at, do I got something in my eye?
Do I got shit up on my face, or did my hair catch on fire?
Cause you really really staring, am I something that you like?
Geez, ask for my number or you can fly kites
See I'm 'bout to get with it, I'm getting ratchet and livid
You think I'm cool, then forget it
You feeling froggy then ribbit
Be like banana and slip it, before your melon I'll split it
I bet you know what you see, oh my girl she deserve a
Beat down


Stop, wait
Think about it

Work, work, run up, if you want some
Hear the drums how they beat here, that's how you done
Wait, I should think about it, never mind it's a waste
When the bitch hit the ground, how these Louboutins taste
I'm sorry, club promoter, let's put this in the past
It's just that bitch kept on staring, so I had to whoop that ass


[Hook: Iggy Azalea]
It's a party in your face, I'm about to dance on it

Beat down


Check it out ladies, don't take no lip
Take no lip, take take no lip

Beat down[Intro x3]

I don't wanna hurt ya but I'm about to work ya
Watch your mouth drop real low
I'm turning you up, I'm burning the clutch

DJ running it back once more, time to party that's all I know
Grab somebody tell 'em, "Baby, baby, baby let's go!"

All about money, the night's never ending
We party till morning, tomorrow we kick it

Let ya hair down and shake that shit, shake that shit, shake that shit
Sweat it out, go nuts in this bitch
Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips

Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go-go-go

You should've known better
Than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby


[Verse 1]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...


[Pre-hook: Rita Ora]
You used to be, thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean forward
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shhh

She just be scrambling, looking I did be clean
Tossing that box like shipping and handling
She be going, yeah, she be doing anything
Natural, stage jumpin off, she a trampoline
Straight, straight boinking this bitch

Red bottom ass heels on
Hair laid, it's fly shit
Twerk something, I might let you through
But don’t touch nothing, that’s my shit
Oh that’s cute, same outfit
Different color, same swag
She jumping off when she leave the club
Body spray in her Gucci bag
Pole going ass ho
You and your main bitch front row
Hoes lined up outside
Wanna shake that ass at my show
Let me tell you something you don’t know
On my neck and wrists is trap gold
My ass fitted in Levi
Swag so rodeo
It’s bitches in the building and it’s bitches on the couch
She tidy up her best friend, before she leave that house
She got her best friend, that's a freak bitch
A freak bitch, tickets to my concerts on her wishlist




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
B.Y.O.B, bring your own bitch
She don’t sleep,she smoke trees
No boyfriend, got cold feet
Low key, she’s so sweet
Just lonely, but so freaky
Acting wild like ho please
Fly around, I go deep
She don’t creep, I fuck hoes
She cool with that, she love those
It’s funk so her gusto
If not so she one of those
Til it’s come close, gotta love Jones
What’s under your clothes I wanna know
Her ass huge, her back screwed up
With a bunch of bad tattoos
Me she make an exception but she usually fuck black dudes
My cashews all in her mouth
In the club, more than her house
Come through, she might hit the loud
Go animal like in and out
Threesome, I need some
My hoes is European, Norwegian, Puerto Rican, even some vegan

[Hook]
[Hook]
I tell a bitch I'm bossing
So make ya offer, if it's money we're talking
Man step in my office
Promoters calling me often
From the Bay out to Boston
And overseas they know what it's costing
Bitch I'm bossing!


[Verse 1]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch,I let you spread the rumors
Yeah you talking shit, but not an ounce is true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough running like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money,insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while I’m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
No trending topic

Hey let me show you that watch
You supposed to wear,hey get up out

Tell your mom and dad that you straight
Don't worry 'bout it you got it
You fly over in coach and fly back in a jet,
Hustle Gang on your chest,
Ain't no time for no stress


[Iggy Azalea]
We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
Eating crumpets with the sailors
On acres without the neighbors
We fast-forward four years more
We a long way from piss poor
And all the shit that we endured
I told you what you was in for so




[Hook x4]
[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could

Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Baby I could help you make that change
I can show you how to do this thing


[x2]
I can show ya, show ya (show ya, show ya...)






[Hook x4]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
Once you go great, you never go good
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
I'mma change your life, I'mma change it
I'mma change your life (life)[Sample, Repeat X2]
For you
Uh, you know what I'm talking about, baby?
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
For you

D.R.U.G.S


[Iggy: Verse 1]
Usually I don't like thugs, who bust guns but
I got a thing for this burgundy one
Even though I can't read him, too much dirt on his palms
For me to see exactly what he got in his heart

Even though I know the seventh letters hold it in forever
Even though he got an ex who's still around, he will do better
When he ready, when he pick me to be honest, it is all the same as long as you are with me

I see other couples flimsy, we be homies till you ready
When other girls you fucking start to make you feel empty
I'll be there for that scene, I'll be waiting in the wings
For you to turn to my page - let beautiful begin with me


[Sample, Repeat Until Ending of Song]
For you
Uh, you know what I'm talking about, baby?
I never meant to hurt you
I never wanted to see you cry
For you[Empty Section]

Verse 2:

Im talkin round and round, but no merry-go
Hoes see me out and say "there she go"
You know point and look. You know stop and stare
Yeah im racked up, but not stopping there
You see me in the store then im copping that
Clutch full of that green, Rodman hair
You know first class champagne designer life is my campaign

He went down and he kissed it
This pink pussy no lipstick
More like lip gloss when it's sticky
Ain't no bitch bossin' like Iggy
I'm gettin' head with my shades on
He head over heels, he way gone
Got his face looking all painted on
When he done getting his taste on
But ain't no returning the favor
When you get done, put your name on this waiver
Makin' a statement bout how you ate this
Banana pudding and vanilla wafer
I'm giving it to you no chaser
But this pussy be wet on the rocks
Iggy do fades and braids it really don't matter
This pussy gone drip on them locks
That Hello Kitty, no pencil pouch
This pussy neat like its stenciled out
I got his tongue shining call him Mr. Clean
It's like Listerine when he rinse it out
Got these girls callin' on missions now
They say they mad cause they missin' out
But I'm verifying his face card
And he say he love it when he kiss it now






I'm jumping out the gym like a motherfucking Laker, ho
Do me one favor, don't do me no favors
And I get 380 every time he 360
Got my old dude calling, got my new dude with me
Started in the A then he licked me to the Bay
Pit stop in Texas, slow it up, drank
Asking, "Baby how it taste? I bet it taste good."
[Hook 1 + Hook 2]
[Bridge]
[Verse 2]
I be cooling out on Slauson, I bet it taste hood
Got me like, "Yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo and Louis."
No department stores I'm in boutiques
If it ain't high class, it don't suit me
Got that bubblicious, that chewy
Make your man act like a groupie
You like fruit? Then imagine I'm smoothie
Pussy monster, give me that Tunechi
Said he wanna blow fish, I'm hootie
Follow my legs to my booty
Self sufficient I do me, broke hoes think I'm bougie
Moody? Who me?
Wild and unruly
So I drop the top on that two-seat while his tongue roll on my tootsie



[Hook 1 + Hook 2]
[Bridge]
[Verse 1]
I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder
Grow stronger and get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
Cause I don't want none of that fake love
Cause how I'm looking at it, all of that be made up


[Hook]
I remember when I wasn't this big
And now ya'll wanna act like ya'll helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
I did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone

I don't need y'all anyway (6x)
I don't need y'all


[Verse 2]
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stressing more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talking 'bout
No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking 'bout VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
So now I need money, put it all in my discussions




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
First things first, I'm the realest (realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that


[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh


[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw




[Hook: Charli XCX]
[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I’m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, aow!


[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
And so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing,slayin' these hoes
Gold trigger on the gun like



[Outro: Iggy Azalea &amp; (Charli XCX)] (x2)
[Hook: Charli XCX]
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y

Little Snicker Bar diamonds, twinkle, twinkle Big Dipper
To all you little stars, it's me, Problem
Problem got some fun, got some change
[Hook]
[Verse 1: Problem]
Threw someone's golfer swing
Clubs and hoes think I'mma put a hole in one for real

Diamond [?] and brought drugs with me pills and that white girl
And I don't mean Iggy
I'm on a war path so the thing with me so you better run son
And I don't mean Diggy

But that bitch right there so bad you should be bi for one night (at least)
