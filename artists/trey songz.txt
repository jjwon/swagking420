She picks up the phone
In my head I know I'm wrong
I just want to know what she's heard
I'm pacing back and forth, cause I know that I've been caught
Trying to think of the perfect words

So I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'mma run to her and lie right to her face

Fly, That probably means you make me feel some type of way
Shoutout Miami for having so many foreign babes


[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber &amp; (Trey Songz)]

Like Ou la la la, oh oui oui, c’est la vie
Off up on the islands, screams turn to silence
Fuck, drink, sleep
Hit it seven days ‘cause you know your man's weak
Make that body talk, know to make that thing speak,such a freak




And she be like "Ay que rico" when I'm going real deep though
You can give me all of them besos, just stay low, do what I say so
Fuck me now, oh damn, shawty go H.A.M, do with no hands
Got me so high, Holland, Amsterdam, Iceland , China, Tokyo, Japan


Don’t understand what she speaks, but I break her body down, sheesh

If my man found out you was using his rubbers I'd be dead
If your girl found out you was paying my rent, she would lose her head

If my girl found out you was on her side of the bed, she'll kill me
If your man found out I was on his side of the bed, he'll go HAM
If my girl found out you was wearing her robe, I'd probably go missing
If your man found out I was wearing his slippers- wait
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about nobody but you

Girl, you can call my phone at four in the morning
Girl, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling
Girl, you can come with me to her favourite diner
She even took me home so I could meet her mama


[Verse 2: Mila J]
If my man found out you was using his rubbers I'd be dead
If your girl found out you was paying my rent, she would lose her head
If my man found out I was washing your drawers he'd pull out the desert eagle
If your girl found out how good I was riding that- wait
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about nobody but you




Boy, you can call my phone at four in the morning
Boy, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling

Tell the DJ turn it up
Bet the DJ bring it back
Tell him play that shit again
Tell him that you like that, like that, oh!
(Trey, I ain't got but 2 reasons to be here man)
All the ballers poppin' bottles


I know it's somebody birthday
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Yeah and somebody gettin' drunk too
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancing like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture, where your phone at?


I only came here for 2 reasons
I came for (Whatchu came for?)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
[Hook: Trey Songz]
Bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks
What you came for?
Baby get your glass up
Only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby get your ass up
That's what I came for


I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street
Stop trippin' you can't control that freak
Ain't nobody got a body like hers
Ghetto booty, but she came from the burbs
Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me
Two white girls dancin' on me
[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone
Waitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone




I hit the club and buy the bar
In VIP just see my partners and a lot of broads
[Hook]
[Verse 3: T.I.]
And such a GIP jam bottle poppin', party hard
I'm done with today, I'm lookin' for tomorrow
All I do is turn up, ain't no no it don't concern us
All this bubble kush I burn up, special, regular, reward us
Turn the corners fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'
Bankhead! West side! Eight or nine chicks trailin'
Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like, here you go again (where the bitches and the drink, yo)




Hey girl you heard what I said, get your ass up
If you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska
Chicago, Virginia, New York City
Houston where the girls all thick
LA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this
Matter fact tell the whole GA
Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas

Bust, bust it, what the business is?
Cars, cribs, couple businesses
Lean, Percs and them blacks
Been to hell and back
[Verse 1: French Montana]
Then I cut off my rearview, cause I ain't looking back
Now my bad bitch neck tatted, blue dye my bladder
Rip it off that rack boy, what it cost don't matter
I say starin' down and I'm in it
Trap money I'm spending
PG for that dream team, you fucking right we winning
40, 40, another 40 boy
They ask me why I sell, feel that YSL?

I land in the front, and I start from the back




Hop out the jet, what city is this?

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
3 bitches in bed, I'm like who's titty is this?
They fucked around and let a nigga like me get rich
I don't know another nigga like me exist
These girls be 'bout that YOLO life
I ask you now if you a ho, no right?
But my dick's still meeting with your throat tonight
Pimp game strong, cold as ice
Told em I'd show you right
You pay for pussy, you know the price
That's hard to handle, this life a gamble
I want the dice, minute rice
To business life, I'm an enterprise
And I'll drop whatever on whatever you ain't finna buy
Live every moment like my last, like I'm finna die
Know I sing it now wonder will I sing it when I'm in the sky




Bust it, bust it, she let that 40 flame

Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy


[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her


[Hook: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game


Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more




[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game


[Bridge: Trey Songz]
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)

One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body, eh

And she can't leave me alone cause I drive her body crazy

That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep


Now we on the balcony chilling
She loving the view when we smoke

Got the stars looking down on us
Do it 'til the sunrise up
Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep
She a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like the Energizer
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
She cooking naked, eggs and some bacon

If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping
You'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping
You'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing
You'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

(Verse Two)
I wish that I could run that back
But in life you can't press rewind
Cause the only way to fix this thang
Is to go back in time
Cause if I had my way
Yesterday would be right now
Instead of fighting we'd be making love
Until the sun go down

While you on your rockin' South Pole when it's cold shit

Don't ask me for hooks you can't afford my focus
Ya turns up Trigga turnt up[Verse 1]
The doors open and everybody turns around
To see you walk down the aisle in your pretty white gown
You're holding your daddy's arm, your tears begin to fall
And both of our lives are about to change forever
Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand
The preacher says: "We've gathered here today..."

And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say: "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take


[Verse 2]
I wonder if she's nervous or will she get cold feet
She wears a smile as the diamond shines from her wedding ring
I hope it's everything you wanted to have, you deserve the best
Always knew I'd be the reason for your wedding dress
So beautiful, the way you read your vows
Then the wedding bells ring


[Hook]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say: "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

As the tears roll down your cheek
It's impossible for me to speak
My heart is beating fast
And my knees are feeling weak
So speak now or forever hold your peace
Can't help but wonder from my seat
If he knows you're meant for me


[Hook]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say: "I do"
And I'm so in love with you

It's soft and gushy it's wet and it's smoshy it's smell like badusssy
I'm high on the kushy I leave in the morning she sleeping and snoring what oh nuts
This slut got bucked I think I got like 3 or 4 in
But watching TV is boring
Told her to wake the fuck up she said what's up lick my nut up now I'm rubbing her ass

Mr. Nice Watch

Ah Mr nice watch ugh [x3]
My wrist frigid
It's exquisite
It's acidic
It's the sickest
No matter what watch I rock
Swear it's like a bad bitch just come with it
She said I should wear my Rollex
I know that
Bitch pick one
That platinum with that thick face, or that gold shit, that sick one
All them Marvin Gaye all them off of trey
Money grown on 4 all of most of date
For the time I never knew though
Got me two Hublot's oh
Plus I did for the bitches don't believe I twit pic it
Versace shirt on the boat and Cole video
I'm big pimping,niggas know
Money in the envelope watch you niggas watching I
Always fuck with the paper even when the fucking center folds

It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I make that back, I make that back
Uh nice watch! (Uh Huh)
Uh nice watch! (I know)
Uh nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch

That Way

You see one thing you gotta know baby life is just complicated you know
I be moving around a lot I be city to city writing it's just
I don't know if we ever really be like that with with us you know

2 seater when I roll up
But it's two divas hold up
Ones a cool blower but the other I don't know of
She said something before on how I met her on the tour
I said are you for sure she said boy you a whore [x2]
Listen here bitch watch your mouth
This my shit and I'll kick you out
You so silly you so pretty
But I can't kiss you in your mouth
Same hoes now try to make the phone blow up
Wouldn't be around if the green ain't grow up
Lawnmower whores so it lawns over whores
I don't really have time how am I gonna get to know ya
You body like a rhyme I want to over flow you
Ain't want to fuck with your mind but I guess I overdosed you
And I'm so sorry and it so true

I apologize I don't recollect your name
Let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame
We can take them oh off
Then I gotta catch my plane
You say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way [x2][Hook]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, Wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions


[Verse 1]
Guess it's my fault for not believing she could love, Love me
Hard to believe I treated someone beautiful so ugly
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying

[Hook]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, Wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions


[Verse 2]
Now she's gone, gone, gone
I should've listened, But I didn't
(Me and my bad decisions)
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened
(Me and my bad decisions)
Now I got time to think of all I could've done different
Searched the whole world until I realized the one I needed
Was right there, I was tripping
Wanna what I know you know I love you
Don't I,Never took the time to tell you
So I, Know that shit don't even matter right now
Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now
And I,I know how to fuck a good thing up
Ain't I, Ain't that why I'm 'bout to loseyour love
But that shit don't even matter right now
Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now

[Pre-Hook]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying


She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, Wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions


[Hook]
[Bridge]
God knows I've done some wild and crazy things in my past
And I can't take nothing back
Can't take nothing back, Forced to live with that
Pay the price for making bad decisions

Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying


She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, Wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions

[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]

Now she's gone, gone, gone
And I know that I should've listened
But I
Me and my bad decisions
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened
Me and my bad decisions
I fucked up
No, no
Yes I did
Me and my bad decisions
Ain't no way I could take that back
Me and my bad decisions[Outro]

[Hook]
[Trey speaking]
You know sometimes in life
When you, when you’re going through things
You’re having problems
You just wanna know how to live that
Let the top back ride with a beautiful woman, you know what I mean
I know some of you are like: fuck no
I know what you mean and I can feel that but ay


Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music


Girl I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know


[Hook]
[Hook]
[Trey Songz Verse 1]
Should I go back to the woman
That had my back at the moment
Before the moment when everybody else got on it
What if I was stuck in the hood
Rolling skinny blunts
Doin’ hand to hands
Baby seats and strollers in my mini van
Who the fuck am I kiddin’
This how I’m livin’
Different cities every day
Boy you know it’s different women
See i’m growing as a business
And I’m sitting on some millions
Missing Thanksgivings
Got the bank flippin'
You don’t understand my reality is different
Addicted to this life yet life’s what’s missin’
Yeah, let that manifest man i’m just in another world ridin with you girl


Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music


I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I (got a lot of shit going on) had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know


[Hook]
[Hook]
[Trey Songz - Verse 2]
And listen I figure it’s only right
That I been getting to this money
‘Cause I feel like for so long
They have been trying keep it from me
So many different women tell me that they love me
I just tell them keep it
From me
‘Cause that picture could get ugly
Passionate as ever but my heart is tough as leather
See the pain in Tremaine
Sometimes bury the pleasure
But whatever
Cheddar, I was raised be about it
Say you can’t leave with it
But I can’t be without it
Yeah I think that I’m the shit all the time
If you don’t then do you, that’s some shit you need to get off your mind
You don’t think that you’re the shit can’t sit in my ride
That’s why I keep a bad bitch in the ride


Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music


I would have came, would have came (yes I would) back for you
I just needed time (I wanted time, wanted time) to do what I had to do
Caught in the life(caught in the life) I can't let it go
Whether that’s right

Ain't nothing sweet in my Sweet
See I start off slow, go deep
Got an uptown bitch, it’s over

Yeah, Young be the boss
Everyday of the week I floss
Look off-white rocks, no denim
Look off-white drop, no rental
Yeah, top down in the Winter
Say I ball too hard, Sportscenter
I’m in the club with my ice out
Start blowing up my iPhone
Like "where ya at? Where ya been?
What ya doing tonight, can you hit it again?
From the back, while I’m on the scene
While you smoking blunts while you drinking drinks
While your other broads blowing up your phone
While you pulling my hair with your Nikes on"[Empty Section]

Send a picture to my phone
Cause when I'm looking at my lova, I don't wanna see anotha
Body on a milli-on

I could be your dream (if you leave it's a nightmare)
If you leave I'll be right there
Waitin', I'm impatient
So you better make it right, Yea

Say he can lay it down, but I'mma beat it up
I'mma beat it up, I-I-I'mma beat it up
He can lay it down


[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I hop up out my bed
Got my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon
Two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, so icy with benefits
My driver need a passport
All my cars are immigrants
It's so sickenin', history you're witnessin'
I had a girl, she quit me
Now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me
If you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confronting 'ruly
Ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy
O.A. Verdy rollin' dirty
Wardrobe clean, that's just detergent
Got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin' me
I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me
So mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it
Beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets
Got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back
Old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there
Smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate
Oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet
Never been a minute man
Always been a business man
Got her catching feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am?
Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't
Got a real short attention span




Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on
My shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
She got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch
To feel it too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean
So extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screaming Gucci
Every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often
But I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie
Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin'
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin'
Rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'

[Hook]
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Work, work, work, work, stashed up at my girl's spot
Hair weave killer had on Louie's in my mug shot
Yeah, yeah, one shot, two shot, three
Damn I pull up with this mother fucker fish tailing
And I'm raw, fish scale
Bloomingdale and Neiman Marcus
Take the beat and make it a carcass
Shop at Saks Fifth like it's a Target
Closet the size of your apartment
I'm swagged up so don't try me
Bank roll is my ID
When I pulled out she hopping in
Make your main girl my side piece
Listening to that old Jay-Z
One eye open like CBS
So much Promethazine I'm VIP at CVS
Long way from EBT
Every time I spit it's a DVD
And I don't care if she gone, in a long skirt
I'll take her home and do her like homework


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Creeping on the campus in my new Camaro
Cover of the Washington Post,Solbiato apparel
Ross and Folarin, couple women
Got them thugs with me, yeah, we about that business
I'm talking Ambition, I could spell it for you
Rev up the Lamborghini, and hail it for you
My pocket's fat, somebody check my blood pressure
Red Bottom's a stack, there goes a double bidder
I can't throw no ones, only tens or better
Since Wale met me he only rode a Benz or better
Double MG, we millionaires
Shawty my bait, she say she never scared


[Hook: TCB (Wale)]
Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait
Who's on my line? Who's on my line?
I'm blowing up, these bitches calling me
Bait, bait, bait, bait, bait
I snatch your girl if you're slipping
She's on my line like I'm fishing I got that
(Work, work, work, work
Yeah you know I got that work
I'm why baby mommas leave
I'm why baby fathers kirk)
I snatch your girl if you're slipping
Double MG not to mention


[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Touching on that ass, tryna get a feel
I just had to ask, tell me if it's real
I ain't tryna diss you
It's really not an issue
If it's fake or if it's real I'mma keep you on my reel, still
Bait baby, wait baby
Why don't you just get a little taste baby
I will never judge, fuck a judge, fuck a case baby
Ooh shawty, you shawty, come and be my new boo shawty

[Verse 4: Wale]
Yeah you know I got that work, women second, family first
Money never ever hurt 'cuz rapping got a lot of perks
Hold up, wait, these Nikes don't got no date
It ain't gon' be no back and forth
But I do quite well with all the bait
That remix flow, Mocco bread, PG though
165 and I'm not surprised see my flow yuck! My CD gross!
Black Ghost, white driver, such an Oreo, I'm thinking out loud
In the back seat and it's getting quite loud
Point 'em all out, I can sit 'em all down
Double MG, what about y'all?
These SB's ain't never coming out
God Forgive and We Don't, keep my circle small you can't get in my crowd
104, that MLK, know I gotta be Landoverout the way
And I gotta thank the young boy Alizay
We gon' rep the city of Folarin straight, that bait

[Hook]
