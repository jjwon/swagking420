[Intro: Chris Brown]
I told her "fuck that nigga"

Mustard on the beat ho


[Hook: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her "Fuck that nigga"


[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
We sitting in the back of the club
Table got a rope in the front (I don't know ya)
You looking real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a goddamn shame
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just saying
If you got a man back home, I don't know him
What, just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush
Walk on green, I can even hear the putt
K.O shawty when I hit her with a punchline
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time
Ducking from my ex like a one time
Throw a sign when you really tryn' go
Got the car parked right at the door




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Nah, and you don't know my name, no
Just in case you' the feds; I don't know ya
I might'a poured you a drink
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you came
Tryna be my main chick
Passenger side when I lane switch
Top back, two seats only
Ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them
We just seizing the moment
Up all night, throw a deuce to the morning (wait)
Fly mo'fucka, everything is imported (wait)
Don't try to act too important
I know your game
You got a gang of niggas, all over you
But you all over here, on me
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya
Bad bitch only thing I'll call you




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Baby, why you playin'? You heard my name

Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Shout-out Weezy F.,keep a red bone wet

Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man I wouldn't trust that bitch

She wanna fuck all the rappers (uh-huh)




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]

Security better get with the program
Too deep, ain't know where to stand

Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done


[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy,let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
Let's go
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and in again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm banging in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next (let's go)
See the way we on and we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go,don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it and take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it




[Hook]
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doing
I’m Lil Tunechi,I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi,I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution,no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater,got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats popping slime
Nothing five,and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive,these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight,bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right,and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild,been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch




Okay, okay

Cause I got Rozay, a little Bombay, a little peach Ciroc and we faded
Soon as we step in, we got your chick, and yo' chick, and yo' chick
And I know you hate it
Cause we lining up the shots, yungin' got the heat to make em' pop
Soon as we hit the parking lot, then we see all the panties drop
Girl, ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
Yo' bitch choosin' on a real nigga, let her chill nigga
That's real, cause I'm so fucked up, now I'm talking my shit
I'm way to high to be trippin' like this
Niggas hatin' hard, bitches all on my dick
This is what you want, I'mma put it like this; lay it down to the Aug, Trey and Chris remix


Say you luv it (ay), you luv it girl (ay)
You luv it (ay), you luv it girl (uh-huh)
You luv it (ay), say you luv it girl (ay)

She tell me keep fuckin', cause she luv this shit

[Verse 2:]
(it, I love it)
She said she just got her some titties
(She said she just got her some titties)
Can't wait till' I come to her city
(Can't wait till' I come to her city)
I smoke till I choke and I'm dizzy
The liquors invading my kidneys;been chillin' and I feel like killin' you niggas
Bitches been missing me lately (ohh),theyit when I talk to em' crazy (ohh)
Suck a nigga dick, do it with alot of spit, let it drip, yeah catch my babies
Ohhh-whoooa, that's my baby, just do it like you care
Girl don't worry bout' your, hairs fuck up
Cause I'm pullin' it like this
Your man's fucked up, he don't do you like this
Feels so good that a nigga might kiss
If you ask her she gon' tell you like this




[Hook:]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She said make luv, just make luv, just make luv to me
Right now (just do it), and she want to try some new shit (just do it)
She said when I kiss it, go and sing to her (how?)
Like this: Laa-laa laa-laa laa (Laa-laa laa-laa laa)
Don't need full conversation
All we doin' is licking, and fucking, and touching, your booty be speaking another language (Ohh yeahhh)
This real life to his fake shit
Bottles in the air, I'm faded, drinking
I'm so fucked up, now I'm talking my shit

[Outro: August Alsina]
[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don’t see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can’t even get in
Ha ha ha l'ego


[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in ten years, in two days
Ladies love me; I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari


[Hook: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh I’m getting paper
Look at me now, oh look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker


[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
Cause I’m killing every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said on my dick
I ain’t really mean to say on my dick
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I’m done


[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy,let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
Let's go
Cause I'm feeling like I’m running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
See they really really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
Cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing
I gotta do a lot of things that make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and in again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm banging in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next (let's go)
See the way we on and we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go,don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin' in
And we always gotta do it and take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it




[Hook]
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doing
I’m Lil Tunechi,I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi,I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution,no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater,got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats popping slime
Nothing five,and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive,these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight,bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right,and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild,been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch




Okay, okay
[Hook]
[Outro: Chris Brown]
Is that right
I’m fresher than a motherfucker[Intro: Chris Brown]
Welcome to the cypher
Myself, K-mac, Ace Hood, Tyga
It's the cypher, let's go


[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill
And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal
No hard feelings pimpin', it's what authentic is
Month old denims thirty grand in the steel
Sleepin' on me I put gas in your Nyquil
Gettin' money while your pockets on the diet pill
Flow knock 'em cold out like Benadryl
Glock cold fourteen, call it Emmett Till
Yea, billionaire it's a state of mind
Thats the rollie on thankful for these good times
Michael Corleone back when he was in his prime
Thats how I'm feelin' while I'm fuckin' my new Spanish dime
Damn, and you can tell I'm on another level
He think he better then I? He get the J letter
Yeah jumped in jack be a trend setter
You lookin' at the best how you doin', it's a pleasure


I'm at the top like high note
[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Killin' for survival
Jeffery Dahmer - I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on
Ya'll was sleepin' on me so I had to turn the lights on
My pockets swollen, I should put some ice on it
Shout to Breezy coulda never did this shit alone
Like potty training, coulda never did this shit alone
If we ain't the best to do this, then this shit was wrong
Sicker than HIV I guess that means I'm full-blown
And of course I'm speaking metaphorically
Livin' Fantastic I wonder if there's Four of me
This is just a sample so if you want more of me
You have to rewind time unless the microphone recordin' me
K-Mac rhymin' on the payback,the truth will set you free so I'mma testify and say that
Ballin' like a preacher catch me rollin' in my Maybach
Shinin' cause I blew myself up, Arab


[Verse 3: Tyga]
Look at me now, my dogs said we gon' be rich one day
But I'm Anfernee, I did things the Hardaway
Easy Bake,fast cake,Rearrange your vertebra
Try like a murder case, you gon' need ice gates
Thin ice, I be icier than a winter lake
Oh you, copied my swag, well you a little late
Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J
Smooth Criminal, sweet bass I call it Shawtay
Why you starin' so long, what your eyes gay
Money talk so I just walk and let it translate
You ain't fuckin' with me I don't fornicate
I just let her taste-test than I let my kids chase
Young Money Cash Money dollars, big face
So when you talk new rappers don't compare me
I'mma last king we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB


[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
They said I was down for the count let's make them eat they words
And if it's beef well sweet I make them bite the curb
This probation got me walkin' on the straight and narrow
I'm takin' shots in the club just likes it's double barrel
Come on live through what I been through
This media so fucked up that's why I don't do interviews
And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules
Skateboard kick-flip right in my pool
With two hundred model chicks super gettin' loose
They just wanna big dick did I say that, Opps
Ha, oh my, oh my where's my manners
Pardon me for this grammar, this Virginia country grammar
Going nuts like some Planter's, and my chain feel like an anchor
When I told you to use your head but I ain't want you to be no thinker
Fresher than a mothafucka yeah you got yo stank up
Yeah swallow your pride, yeah go head and drank up[Intro]
Faire l'amour lendemain..


What if the sky was turning red
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed
Laying face to face, oh girl, I love the way you sound
When you rain on me, so tonight let's act it out
Show you how it's gon' be
[Verse 1]
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we finish
Girl we gon'...


[Hook]
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
Telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down


[Verse 2]
All these vibrations from your legs
Massaging my back
I got your body shivering
Cause we're covered in sweat
Girl I like the way it opens up
When you throw it back babe
Girl it might be too much
Babe if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby can you make it disappear
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler




[Hook]
[Bridge]
Do it like we only got one
Baby let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time, do it to you right
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down
But that won't stop me from turning that thing around
Girl yeah
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking
End of the world

[Hook]
[Hook]
Yeah, I got them bullet proof ray bands so haters never in my head

Ladies say I'm long stroking, yeah that’s what she said
Crib like a castle so I'm fucking on that king spread
Haha
Big balling, fuck a loft
Money turn me on
So I had to fuck it off
Skinny ass niggers pockets looking so bulimic
And I'm never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You watching while I'm laughing cause all of you niggers is funny
And they call me Action Jackson cause every day I'm stunting
And I'm writing hit songs like it's nothing
So nigger you bugging, fronting
What you think this is ho?
Paparazzi trying to pop me everywhere that Chris go
Never been no sucker no lame mad nigger
And your flow is more watered down than a drain ass nigga

And I know you not used to rejection
But if you don’t get naked get the fuck up out my section





[Hook: Trey Songz]
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
All up in that VIP, that shit look like a cloud
Guess Aladdin got 200 Jasmines coming to the house
And we banging on that magic carpet, fucking on the couch
All that fettucini say she saw a genie that’s that loud
They say silence is golden, so my chain don’t make a sound
But these bottles I’m holding, I’ma give them to the crowd
Oh, that must be that shit they talking ’bout
Can you hear me now
Or I gotta say it loud?



[Hook: Trey Songz]

[Verse 3: Se7en]

I told her make it wobble while I grab her from behind
Then she made it wind so I ordered some Moscato
A couple hookers and a bucket of that Rose
We up in this bitch, niggas grilling like chipotle
Twenty bottles waters, cranberry and some OJ
Throw that money in the air, watch it fall like a snow flake
I smell like Kush and Dolce
I'm on that gin &amp; juice and I'm feeling like the old Dre
I'll be lying if I said I wasn't drunk
It feels like I smoked a hundred blunts
And I ordered like

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2


Oh my god waiter

But boy you will never phase me

Got these bad bitches jizzing
Holdin' down my city, but I picked up that commission
Boy, I run my city so you might need my permission

Seen her in a wedding dress, I've seen her in her night gown
Will she take me out to eat, while you'll be trying to eat her out
Got a hundred fucking bottles boing with my weiner out
Damn right, I got a hundred fucking bottles

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2[Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me
I have so many regrets, this isn't how things used to be
You're never satisfied
Guess what? I'll stop fuckin trying
You suck
In case you didn't know, you're horrible
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying


[Hook - Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
Cause you're way too complicated


You're such a snobby girl, used to think you were a queen
[Chris Brown]
Damn, sure did rain on my parade
Same old silly games you play, this is such a waste of time
Starting to think that you're insane - cukoo cukoo!
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying




[Hook]
[Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, what else can I do?
I've had enough of your truths
Yeah you're way too Soduku, true
Ain't in no mood for proofs and square roots
Go ahead, run and find yourself another man
Figure you wild, I'm sick of your mouth
Bout to slit at them wrists and sleep on the couch
Yeah, stick to my decision
Chick I'm kicking you out
No mathematician, take the digits and bounce
You got me screaming out[Intro:]
Ay, can I talk to you for a minute?
You new around here?


Girl ain't no way, I won't let you down
If you let me I will show you how, (I like what I see)


Ain't no way (ain't no way)
I'm gone let you down (let you down)
I know it's hard right now (hard right now)
To say yes to me

But I'm gone make you say you love me
The way (girl the way), you look to me now (to me now)
We need to get down (let's get down)
You don't know but
I'm gone make you say you love me girl


I ain't never fell for a girl like you (like you)
With jeans and a body that curves like you (like you)
[Pre-Hook:]
[Hook:]
[Verse 1:]
I don't really care what they say, when it comes to a difference of age
I can show you all the things I'll do
Break your heart, never raise my voice
Girl let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me, but I can make a difference right now you'll see
Shorty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Everytime you walk pass
Oh




For a minute can you just think about us two?
Swerving in my 645 SU, me leaning over the seat
I'm passing you your own set of keys, showing you just how the teen got you
Trust and believe these words, from me been said before
Tricking ain't my M-O.But girl you represent everything
That Chris is about so shawty please
Shawty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Everytime you walk pass,oh




For you girl, I'll buy you anything
Just to have you close to me
Cause you know ya loving is off the wall
Can't nothing come about, we'll take it slow
I ain't like the ones' ya know
I'm gonna make ya love me all night long

[Hook]
[Verse 2:]
[Hook]
[Bridge:]
[Hook:]
[Verse 1]
I got money
Everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing


[Hook]
Feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
Cause I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy


[Verse 2]
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing




[Hook]
[Bridge]
I'm so alone, I feel so alone, so alone in this world
Got everything I want

[Hook]
[Intro - Bow Wow]
Hey Chris. Hey man
You know it's been a long time you know since we hooked up and did something, real, you know
For the ladies, ya dig that
Oh yeah! You know we! You know we! You know we do it for the ladies!


[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I got a couple of girls on call; I'mma a bring em out
A Magic City stripper, huh, so this what this all about?
I'm in the club doing my two step
I pulled about eight broads already, I'm just getting my feet wet
But I ain't even knocking your style
Cause I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Oooh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look bad
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
See it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo, Bow!


[Hook - Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)


[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
We don' been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
You callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
You don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like
But I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one
All the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me




I told her, I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas' (my niggas)
Hey (hey), I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas man'


[Hook]
[Bridge - Bow Wow]
[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
I'm bein' honest, listen shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
Cause you losin', and she choosin'
And like Chris said I'm chunkin' up the deuces
On to the next one.All I ask is keep it real
Couldn't do that; so I'mma tell you how I feel
I'm poppin' bottles all night
Cause that black cardain't got no limit alright

[Hook]
[Hook: Asher Roth]

You, me, her, her, her, you, me
Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree
Go ahead, fall back, [?] boy gon' breathe
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Floating, sipping, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up, acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up




[Hook: Asher Roth]
[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo
Checking my fresh, everything brand new
Sexy old dude, saying "who's you?"
You do me, and I'mma do you
What what, what you talkin about Willis?
Man fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch
Gotta have respect for my bad habits
P-p, now pass me the tree

Pull out the cameraand shoot me a links
Cause I'mma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, [?]

Good girl gone bad, grab my bud



[Hook: Asher Roth]

Oh I, I gotta slow it down
Yeah I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now
Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow
So you better watch out cause I’m oh so ahh

I like women and French kisses
Mama told do the dishes but I'm here catching fishes
Cause I'm still young and acting up
Girls on my mind, so I still mack up
They see the money, see the money, rack up, till the walls dark green, cause I'm stacking up
Bass loud, hands up,I don't really give a fu--
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up


Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up
[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up
Young old school like Galaga
But I'mma call these shots, caliber
What it is JB, my Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies
My chain heavy, give it to the ladies
Hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy
Chilling with Asher Roth
Girls let me touch, cause their ass is soft
Yes I'mma score with them basketballs
She gon' give it up, I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step
I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like "who's next?"
So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it!"
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Smoking, drinking, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up

[Intro:]
Yea, it go

Black shades, dark tint

And you know they get the party bouncing like a pogo
I'm in slow mo
But fast forward me to the part where me and yo girl underneath the sheets
Just keep yo eyes on,got a whole bunch of niggas behind me wearing red, Verizon
New money, I get my super size on
I like a long hair, bad chick, thighs long
Knowing all the words to my songs
And she fucking every girl that's on my phone
I'm, I'm so fly; flight models up cause I'm so high
Lil nigga get your cheese up
Black Ice On My Neck, Make You Freeze Up
Oh You Worry About Me, Go Figure
I Ain't Sweating It, Fuck Them Old Niggas
Lambo, Range Rove, With My Pants Low
I Got The Audience Clapping Like A Backboard
She Put Her Hands Up, And Then I Stand Up
And Getting To Working On The Pole, Like A Dancer
I Double Up, I Call It Double Dutch
Two Girls at the same time, What The Fuck?!
Rabbit Foot In The Air, Cause My Luck Is Up
Bring the first aid out, cause I'm cutting up
Bang Bang, Now That's Some G Shit
No Chain Gang, Like I'm Really On Some Free Shit
Their jaw dropped, I'm leaving niggas speechless
World premiere, get a sneak peek bitch
I'm Great, Today Is A New Day
Fucking With Me, Do The Moon Walk On Your Face
No Games, I'm Oh So Serious
And ya'll niggas are straight pussy, period
They Say A Singer Can't Rap, I Ain't Hearing It
Cause After These Couple Songs, I Been Killing Shxt
Oh No, Niggas Saying I'm Loco
But they Pinocchio niggas, watch their nose grow
It's Young Money, Shouts Out My Nigga Tyga Too
They On Their First Mixtape, I'm On Volume Two
Turn Me Up, I'll Show You What A Tiger Do
And I'm a Rip This Beat Up Like Lion Food
Louie Luggage, And The Case For The Passport
I Don't Buy Shit, Nigga I Ask For It
I'm The Freshest, I'm The Best
I Suggest That I Get It Off My Mother Fucking Chest
Breezy![Verse 1]
If I had the moment
I capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret
The secret to your love
I would place the treasure beneath my heart
Lock it all up
And throw away the key
I would never give it up
Cause I was just a fool
A fool for you
When I loved you so childishly


[Hook]
And I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all
Girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all


[Verse 2]
If there is a green light
And it starts to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor
Cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind not your body instead
I was just a fool, a fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Every single moment
That you’re not here
It's evident to me that everything just seems so clear




[Hook]
[Bridge]
Now everything isn’t everything
If everything, everything isn’t with you
Yeah!



[Hook]
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back[Intro: Chris Brown]

But I got to (on tonight)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We don been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
She gotta ball player, but a nigga ain't tripping
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My blackberry filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
Yeah you don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like but I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one, all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me


[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(Aye aye aye) I ain't thinking about you tonight (na na na na)


[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one, if you think I ain't gonna go out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would Think About
I gotta couple of girls on call, I'm a bring 'em out
A Magic City stripper huh, so this is what it's all about
I'm in the club doing my two-step
I done pulled about eight broads already
I'm just getting my feet wet (Damn)
But I ain't even knocking your style
See I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Yea I See You On The Blogs With Your Dude And All That
But little do you know, you making yourself look wack
If Dude Gotta Problem, Better Tell Him To Fall Back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
Shit, it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better cuff your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo




Shawty wassup

You sexy, God damn you sexy
Oh you sexy, ohhhhhh

You could meet me at my hotel suite, naked
She was like, "Nah,"

So used to being regular
She don't understand, a man ten steps ahead of her!

She seeing lights like a signal
And I'm asking, "What ya all up on me for?"
Cause we go...

No death never scare me
Death where is thy sting
Grave where is thy victory
They don't remember your reveal look at history
But I'm gonna make sure these niggas remember me
Start a family legacy
For everyone that's kin to me
See I'm a paint a portrait so vividly

You're a breath of fresh air
I need you without you I can't live
You're in cahoots with my heart (that's the way you stole it)
Gotta be a insider job
You're a diamond, short of perfect
But you're body still sparkles
I'm on a knee holding your left hand
I knew where that missing diamond should


Go ooh oh ooh oh oh oh
[Pre-hook:]
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
I didn't think so


[Hook:]
Feel like I just won the lotto
I found a 1 in a million you (oh)
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold
There will never be another you (ooh)
Never be another you
Never be another you


[Verse 2:]
Now I can spend my whole life
Searching for something that's better than my dear
But that's a waste of my time (cause what’s better than perfect?)
Nothing that’s what my point is
You can stand in front of the mirror
And there wouldn't be a reflection
Cause there's only one you
And that's why I never let you




[Pre-hook:] + [Hook:]
[Breakdown:]
I'm a firm believer
In Never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say what ever
And it don't even matter
Cause I know our love is true [x2]


Felt like I just won the lotto
I found a 1 in a million you
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mold
There will never be another you
Never be another you
Never be another you
(Woah woah oh) [x5]
There will never be another you
(Woah woah oh) [x5]
There will never be another you...[Hook:]
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back

Another round
Oh I know I want another round
Another round


I used to want you and her and her
And you with her and her
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'mma give you my all
All I want is you


[Chris Brown]
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Hair in a bun cause sometimes your hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more




[Hook: Chris Brown]
[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Cake cake cake cake cake, I know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you, you a star
I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard
In these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
See, she done came down
Double cup with ice
Man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong
Cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three can you keep up with me

[Hook: Chris Brown and Mary J. Blige]
[Chris Brown - Hook]
Don't you be holding back, your love
Don't you be holding back
Don't you be holding back, your love
Don't you be holding back
Cuz in the end girl you're gonna want another round, another round
Only girl you'll want another round, another round
I used to want you, and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you, and her and her and her
All I want, all I want…

Shawty got a mean walk,a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talking Janet,maybe Kim K
I hear Rihanna, she like it kinky
Come on


Quit playing girl you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it you bad
[Verse 1 - Fat Joe]
Something like Dirty Diana,body dope as heron
And the sex off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well baby just peel off
Loving how it lasts long, Leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat




[Chris Brown - Hook]
[Verse 2 - Fat Joe (Chris Brown)]
Never hesitate, purchasing in every state
Transported in foreign cars to large estates
(So believe me, you know you wanna come on girl)
(As long as we can kick it with your home girl)
Had two on one fast break that's a slam dunk
I know you want it,I can take you where ya man won't
Champs, Alize,think Rolls Royce
Yellow Nuvoand pink boy shorts




Girl you got tha bomb thing on I can't resist
[Chris Brown - Hook]
[Chris Brown - Bridge]
I'mma light some candles girland then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off your stomach
Baby you ain't handled freaky shit like this
And I start dripping ice down ya spine (oh oh)
And make you mine
And now you're telling all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me, there's room for all of us

[Chris Brown - Hook]
