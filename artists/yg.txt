[Intro: K Camp]
[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I had a super bad chick, she kept runnin' her mouth
Kept talkin' all bitch, so I cut that bitch off
Fire, ho, these hoes know I'm the man when I walk through
Alex just paid me 80 grand for a walkthrough
30 chains on, Boosie keep these hoes lookin'
I could have the whole strip club, so I don't need your pussy
My exes talkin' 'bout when I was young and moved that dope
They ain't got me no more, you a woulda coulda shoulda ass ho
I'm so hot, so hot, you know, since I've been home they call me hot sauce
Straight goon, it ain't nothin' to get you knocked off
Foreign with the top off, runnin' since I got out
I can't get that fire head, I'ma cut your ass off
Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious
"Boosie you just gon' cut me off?" I told you I was serious
Told you take the shot, girl, so you can't have no period
But you ain't listen, it's consequences


It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho


[Hook: K Camp]
[Verse 2: YG]
Bitch I'm from West Side, Tree Top Bompton
You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch
Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin'
Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off
I know the situation, I don't need no explanations
Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you


[Verse 3: K Camp]
You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know




Real playas represent
Yeah mane, you know, it's like that sometimes
Look
It's over, yeah it's nothin' to me
I fucked with you, and you fucked it all
So it's over, bitch[Hook: K Camp]

He sell it for the high, I need all mines nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think

I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch no, that ain’t my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch no, that ain’t my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah that’s my nigga

Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]

Me and my down ass nigga get twisted
Nigga get to trippin', knock the gravy out your biscuit
Just know I fucked with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I’m like, "Hey, my nigga!"
Drink that act right by the case, my niggas
Drink that act right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty trynna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don’t matter, go figure




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
My nigga got cake, my nigga got weight

And we're still hittin' licks, my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off a nigga shit, my nigga, my nigga
I fucked a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talkin' shit then he ain’t my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga and I ain’t goin' in,ain't trynna leave my niggas
Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga
But it wasn't enough room cause I came with my niggas

On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no belly
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos

A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big

Glocks in my ma's house

You say you want that head up
But we don't fight fair brah
Catch you slippin' from your backside, then knock you out
Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gon' stomp you out
(Has momma ever seen you with a busted eye and busted mouth?)
Nine milli pokin' out, 4 Fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days show you what this West Coast about


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro
Don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas
Vice versa,eyes red from the kush I blew
White person,got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas
Tunechi!


I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas

And when we on that lean, we ain't fuckin' with the liquor
I'm a buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches
She keep liking all my pictures
Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and that be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have em screamin' “Caine get up"
Same nigga from the bottom ain't a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin' "money ain't a thang"
In a red Mulsanne, lookin' like I claim blood
And if homie ain't my homie then I know it ain't love
Screamin' out "4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga
Cause I been in the field life on the line with him
And if it's really good, why I prolly die with em
Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tak hit 'em



[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I just got 250 thousand dollars for a verse, nigga
I don't know, is it me or it's your thirst, nigga?
You nig, you niggas ain't got no joints
Like a injured Chris Paul, you ain't got no point
I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some "don't cross me" bitches
Flossy bitches,Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries apple pies other bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches
I need a nigga with some different strokes, Todd Bridges
Shout out to my main bitches, and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches
My niggas

So she can divide her legs on this dick like a fraction, right?
Right, left, hit 'em with that right, left

No panties on, I can see your pussy through that white dress

And better yet, fuck with me for better sex
I know all the right spots to keep that punani wet

She just wanna strip and make a million right?
So she could get rich and feed the children right?
She ain't got no ass shots her shit real, yo
Got her checkin' in with me like I was a P.O
I hate make-up, I hate broke hoes
I can’t talk to you bitch, I ain’t social
Where the bad bitches at? Let me know though
I can send this dick your way baby, postal
Is it Brittany? or Myisha?
Where the ghetto bitches at? Queesha and Syeeda?
She dancin' for them dollars cause she don't know no better

Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers

You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life,bet that on the ten or four, nigga
She bouncing that ass, go ahead shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches are fakin'
You fightin', and savin' these hoes, know that you losin'

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I had a super bad chick, she kept runnin' her mouth
Kept talkin' all bitch, so I cut that bitch off
Fire, ho, these hoes know I'm the man when I walk through
Alex just paid me 80 grand for a walkthrough
30 chains on, Boosie keep these hoes lookin'
I could have the whole strip club, so I don't need your pussy
My exes talkin' 'bout when I was young and moved that dope
They ain't got me no more, you a woulda coulda shoulda ass ho
I'm so hot, so hot, you know, since I've been home they call me hot sauce
Straight goon, it ain't nothin' to get you knocked off
Foreign with the top off, runnin' since I got out
I can't get that fire head, I'ma cut your ass off
Period, you say I ain't the man then you're delirious
"Boosie you just gon' cut me off?" I told you I was serious
Told you take the shot, girl, so you can't have no period
But you ain't listen, it's consequences


It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothin' to cut that bitch off
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho
So what you sayin', ho? You know I'm the man, ho


[Hook: K Camp]
[Verse 2: YG]
Bitch I'm from West Side, Tree Top Bompton
You ain't shit, actin' like you faithful but you're everybody's bitch
Everybody done hit, everybody did somethin'
Your ass butt naked, that's why I cut you off
I know the situation, I don't need no explanations
Lyin' to me like I was slow, bitch this ain't The Matrix
I got the naked pictures, yeah the ones you sent to everybody
You was hoin' so much, a nigga couldn't care about you


[Verse 3: K Camp]
You thought I was playin' when I cut that bitch off
I'm just tryna get inside that hole like you're golf
Oh that girl too nasty, she gon' suck it 'til it's soft
Runnin' 'round with balls, woulda thought this was lacrosse
You can't tell me ain't the hottest in your city, that I know
I see these niggas hatin' but they love it on the low
Every city that I hit, them bitches, they're in the front row
I asked myself "Why he mad", but I found out that's his ho, that I know




Real playas represent
Yeah mane, you know, it's like that sometimes
Look
It's over, yeah it's nothin' to me
I fucked with you, and you fucked it all

Okay, okay, okay
Told her bust it open she said: "okay!"
But what she wearing? Chanel and Dolce
How she want it? Beat up like O.J
Skurt, skurt on a bitch nigga
How much time do you got for a rich nigga?
I need that while I'm relaxin' and the bitch knows gymnastics
So she can divide her legs on this dick like a fraction, right?
Right, left, hit 'em with that right, left
I got that best stroker, I don't need no pipe test
My dick work girl I don't need no mic check
No panties on, I can see your pussy through that white dress
I ain't trippin' baby girl, make that money
Cause if I fuck her right she just might give some to me
And better yet, fuck with me for better sex
I know all the right spots to keep that punani wet


[Bridge]
Girl you know you look fine as hell, right?
You know I buy you that Chanel, right?

She said she expensive, well, I could afford it
Never pay for it, but I could explore it
Have your tongue out and legs cocked open like Jordan
She just wanna strip and make a million right?
So she could get rich and feed the children right?
She ain't got no ass shots her shit real, yo
Got her checkin' in with me like I was a P.O
I hate make-up, I hate broke hoes
I can’t talk to you bitch, I ain’t social
Where the bad bitches at? Let me know though
I can send this dick your way baby, postal
Is it Brittany? or Myisha?
Where the ghetto bitches at? Queesha and Syeeda?

[Verse 1]
It was 1 in the mornin' and I was up yawnin'
Moms asked where I'm goin', to the hood if you ain't knowin'
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
I was out the house, ASAP Rocky
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
We was her babies, she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama, mama said "fuck 'em then"
I was in the streets stylin', nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed


But now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?


[Hook]
[Verse 2]
SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission
On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga, so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's when he leave me[Verse 1: YG]
Glocks in my ma's house
Front you with that work
(I done fronted niggas work)
You say you want that head up
But we don't fight fair brah
Catch you slippin' from your backside, then knock you out
Ace gone stomp you out, then Buddah gon' stomp you out
(Has momma ever seen you with a busted eye and busted mouth?)
Nine milli pokin' out, 4 Fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days show you what this West Coast about


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top off, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro
Don't beef over no ho
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas
Vice versa,eyes red from the kush I blew
White person,got my middle finger on the trigger
And with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas
Except my niggas
Tunechi!


I said that I'mma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My motherfuckin' niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga


[Hook: Rich Homie Quan &amp; Lil Wayne]
[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Ohh! I done spent a million dollars on my motherfuckin' niggas
You catch me out Chicago with them motherfuckin' hittas
Call in RondoNumbaNine,Lil Durk will bring the trigger
And when we on that lean, we ain't fuckin' with the liquor
I'm a buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches
She keep liking all my pictures
Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and that be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have em screamin' “Caine get up"
Same nigga from the bottom ain't a damn thing change
Catch me out in Collins screamin' "money ain't a thang"
In a red Mulsanne, lookin' like I claim blood
And if homie ain't my homie then I know it ain't love
Screamin' out "4 Hunnid,” YG that's my nigga
Cause I been in the field life on the line with him
And if it's really good, why I prolly die with em
Cause when I need the choppers, I just tell Tak hit 'em



[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I just got 250 thousand dollars for a verse, nigga
I don't know, is it me or it's your thirst, nigga?
You nig, you niggas ain't got no joints
Like a injured Chris Paul, you ain't got no point
I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some "don't cross me" bitches
Flossy bitches,Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries apple pies other bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches
Bitches, my bitches

Shout out to my main bitches, and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck, ostriches

Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I don’t wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I’ll beat the fuck out of a nigga


[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy
Hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G
I'm back on that bullshit
But she ain't fuckin' and that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers
All these hoes fuckin', but they don't wanna seem like a ho

Silver satin get the job done
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' crip
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga
We hop out cars, nigga
I be groovin' 'til I die
Smokin' weed until I'm fried
I could sell a key to God
Pants saggin' with the Glock
I ain't wanna pick the box

We keep a thumb between our two fingers
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50's, Ricky

Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gang bang, slap a bitch

You ain't got no hands so they might let the gun touch you
Is you bangin' or you ballin', nigga?
You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life,bet that on the ten or four, nigga
She bouncing that ass, go ahead shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches are fakin'
You fightin', and savin' these hoes, know that you losin'

Cruising down town with me and my crew
Girls on the sidewalk, how do you do ?
I like your bass, that’s something to screw
If you’re looking for a good time, follow the boom
Dip to the liquor store then to the crib
Knock on the door, damn look who it is
It’s the L.A. freaks with all that base
Ain't nothing like a hoochie with an 8o8


Pack that stump in, anything to trunk it
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you’re a basshead
Girl you’re a basshead, girl you’re a bass head

Pop, pop, fizz, fizz

Take a hit blacked out on a cool hit
Cross-faded all day on the new shit
Tripping out when the bass look real fat
She got a sub that can hit like a heart attack
Oh, girl got bass, with a nice shape
Nothing like a hoochie with an 8o8




For my L.A. creep, no sleep, no tweek, just an L.A. freak
All bass, fly tweets, five highness' in the back seat
And they thumping, hell yeah, thump thumping, hell yeah
And they thumping, hell yeah, thump thumping, ya flow girl




So, so fly, face so cute,her cush-cush taste like mango fruit
Heard you looking for a baller, shot caller
She gave me her number but I’m not gonna call her
I know what you gon' to, young 2Pac I got to choose
Them boys like Dr.Seuss now get higher than a mother
Show no love for the suckers, I ain’t never scared like no pressure
Said she love me but I don’t trust her
Get rich and have four baby mothers
Yeah, get hit or get lost
I’m trynna be the same person, pushing lip gloss
Now go girl, it's hurting them hair curls

Even paintings and I was an artist in the making
Used choppers, jewelry boxes, loafers made by Prada
At the pawn shop like what you got I needed all of that
Grind to shine to greedy that's how it had to be
If I ain't know you, to me you was just another robbery
Uh, clubs in the fat head
And if the neighbors saw us we got ghost like Pac Man

Like fuck we finna get caught, hurry and toss the ooh wa
And the freedom change the situation
And fuck the police, them handcuffs is irritatin'
Just wonder what my mom gon' say
When they lock me up and send me miles aways, had to take it day to day
Make you express and share relates
Catchin' cases and catchin' fades
I was in the County makin' plays

Ho, slut, ratchet – I’m going HAM ‘till they put me in the casket
And I'm packing, pimping and macking

Look - I got rich bitches and them bitches got bitches
And I'm giving your mama my digits




Bitch got bitches
Bitch, bitches got bitches
See, I’m at the function
Front row, got it jumping, show trap and I'm funking
Homie, you a woman, probably really want a husband
Bet you feel it in your stomach, hoes get nothing
But some dick and instructions, I don't need no interruptions
So we get scrumptious, man, always into something
Don’t forget the motherfucker, that's my introduction
I'm out here hustling, you off the lean, I'm struggling
Cut it with percussion, start the whip with a button
No keys, just touching, microwave oven
Leave the cooking for the bitches
Unless I'm cooking up a pigeon

Pop a pill, pop a nigga, pop my collar
I'm poppin' like a Tic Tac - bitch you better get back
Funny looking bitch, who been fucking? Sinbad?

Got a crib with a closet, you would think you at the mall
And her mouth like halls in her jaws like wisdom teeth
You hear the beat;I bet you they gone bang this in the Middle East
I been a freak - 9th grade I was fuckin' in the bathroom

My best friend is named Benjamin Frank
So bitch better have my cake, FO' HUNNID
Haha, tatted up, nigga...




Yeah, I'm so high...
Man this bitch better have my money

Bitch better have my mula
Fuckin' round with a real nigga and his shooter
Little dust bag bitch! Make a nigga rich
Shut the fuck up and jump on this dick
Nothin' but a motherfuckin' skank
Fuck what you talkin' bout and fuck what you think
I need money, I need it real fast
I need it real bad like white girls need ass
Baby you can help me, break this dub
20 motherfuckin' racks up up in the club (club, club, club)
Club, up-up in the front
That's why I sent a bitch to get at each one
Triple top rank, treat her like a bank

[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block like what
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house trying to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes!
I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA, I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfucking attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chilling, homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shooting, my homies went back shooting
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Verse 2, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down the guns come out
Click clack bow bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas, that's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfucking biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurking, bitches be slurping
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin
It's a must in the county, I ain't have no pagers
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbating
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios


[Interlude]
Ey nigga, nigga, nigga, I got a whole zone right now

Meanwhile at a home invasion near you

Break a bitch down, gotta put her in a cast
She ain’t got a ride, might put her in a cab
You ain’t even know, nigga? Put him in a class
Trip, Big Chuck might put you in the past
Hit a blunt hard, nigga, put me in the pads
Just rolled up, but the high don’t last
Ridin’ through the city, hope I don’t crash
Know they thought that it wasn’t gon’ last
You can’t even tell me why you mad?

Nigga, I'm from BPT

TTP
(What block? x4)
400, Spruce Street
(What y'all doin'? x4)
Nigga, kill off all beef


[Verse 1]
I’m a Westside get brackin' in the back like what’s happnin'
That 40 Glock snap like Insta, ain't no need for a caption
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it
'Hamad threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect
That's how I got put on
Tree Top Bompton, yeah I got put on
It was hard in the hood
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood
I know Game from cedar block, Dot from the West
That was *static* that popped what's his name in his chest
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on
Niggas gotta go, we can't prolong




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'
Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence
That's a principal of proof, the definition of logic
That this nigga is a bitch, every chance he get he's dodgin'
I brought back this West Coast shit
And this the mothafuckin' thanks I get?
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga ain't snitch
That's how it's s'posed to go down
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down
Give you a blind date, have my bitch pick you up
Then have one of my Top members stick you up
I know Nipsey from 6-0,C-Hood from 10-4
Tiny Bone from 40 Crip,that’s my kinfolk
My whole family tried to save me but it didn't work
Momma know I've been bangin' lately, nigga[Intro]

Got Colony jumping on a Monday
Got Supper club going on a Tuesday
I fuck a basketball wife with a booty

Know some Hollywood bitches who can suck dick
And if you put them on tape, she'll love it
Fucked a couple big stars, I don't judge it
I'm nasty I kiss her in public
To keep it real, on god I don't trust it
I'm just thugging, no loving
No roses just fuck, fucking Huh
