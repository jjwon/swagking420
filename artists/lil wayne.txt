Uhhhh
Rich young nigga
Name got bigger and my change got bigger
So my chains got bigger
Ferrari, Jaguar, switching four lanes
With the top down screaming out, "money ain't a thing"
Hah, me and CB in the bay with her
Send her back home so you can lay with her
Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carrying
All these karats like I'm a fucking vegetarian
Shout-out Weezy F.,keep a red bone wet
Rose rolex, hoes on deck
She know I got a check
Do it too good when she ride that dick
Man I wouldn't trust that bitch
No!


Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon’ cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And it’s all for nothing

[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
[Hook]
[Intro: Lil Wayne &amp; Chris Brown]
YOUNG MULA BAAAAY-BAY!(Let me see)
Haha, you thought it was over?(Let me see)


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain’t right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain’t have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time,I’m the shit, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)


[Hook: Chris Brown]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain’t loyal
These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Bridge: Chris]
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga’s bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don’t fuck with broke bitches


[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the Bob Marley I’m a Rasta
She wanna do drugs (drugs) smoke weed, get drunk (wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers (uh-huh)




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let’s get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That’s a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance





[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
HAH! Once Cirocs in the system
Ain’t no telling will I fuck them, will I diss them
That’s what they be yelling, I’m a pimp by blood
Not relation, I don’t chase em, I replace em (HAH!)
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes, ain’t loyal, man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in the Lotus
She was riding in that hoopty (WHOOP!)
Fuck that bitch
I got my own ho
Fuck your weed
I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on
Montana


[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin’?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon’ cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin’?

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my Daddy
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me


[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah




[Hook: Drake]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'



[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Motherfuck award shows and motherfuck the press like that


[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Motherfuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw motherfuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat,believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

What you think we out here working’ for?
I just wanna buy the world
Do the impossible
Hey hey hey


[Hook: Future]
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch
And let my niggas drive that mothafucka
I swear that court room can minimize a mothafucka
Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucka
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy
Just like assume I get ass from the start
I flip the script when they cast for the part
You ain’t talking to me if you ain’t talking money my nigga
Strength in numbers, my nigga
And I'm number one like my muscles got bigger
Like my puzzles got figured
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga
This is how shit is supposed to be, dawg
Rollie on my wrist and around my neck
I got a chain of command and a food chain on
Shoutout my dog lookin' at the four walls
Shoutout Candace for acceptin' my calls
Impossible ain't impossible at all
Tunechi




[Hook: Future]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
Nigga any problem, bet I overcome that shit
Twenty gold bottles I'ma drink on that shit
Twenty songs that I'm on, number one that shit
My name gon' ring and my team gon' win
I shot a nigga once, and I'd do that shit again
Put your hands on a Bible stealing candy at a store
To a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
Drop down, give me three points ho
K. Dot, give it to it how you want ho
I'ma show you what this West side about
I'ma pull up in a 'Rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
She got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
T-O to N-O to ammo, I mean
My MO is zero, see commas, I promise
Go tell your mama this dick ain't for free
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't, this dick ain't
This dick ain't for free
Touch that, I need cash back, transaction
I bust back in a all black Grand National
Hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
They wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
Holiday cheers, Sallie Mae checks
With a bottle to the neck,get it how you live it



[Hook: Future &amp; Lil Wayne]

I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days
Keep singin' with me
I say hol up (hey!)
I just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
Tell em catch me if they can
I switch gears then switch lanes
You know just what my mind's on these days[Outro: Kendrick Lamar &amp; Kids]
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know, I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho
Got witches all in my broom closet,got little killers in Chuco
We’ll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don’t name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy


[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes lazy
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know


[Verse 3]
Like where the fuck did my heart go , and show me something I haven’t seen
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been, but not to where I’ll never be
And I ain’t never scared but I’m scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies  big letter B , need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine

[]


[Verse 4]
Tell me something I don’t know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready,my family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots,I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic,nigga give me credit... on my balance

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers
On the corners, it gets better as you go
Grind that mothafucka 'til it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre throwin' up the Thizz



[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Well, let me light one for my problems
Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume
Get it crackin' like an eggshell
In this mothafucka make omelettes
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They don't know what I been through
Don't know what I'm goin' through
As long as I get through, that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me; need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9
And I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers
That ain't a threat, that's a bet, cause they coming at my neck
Like the best a man can get,but to make a long story short
I need a shoulder cause the devil on one
The other one, I'm lookin' over

Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business
Cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my mothafuckin' waaangs

Long as my bitches love me

Long as these bitches love me

Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she's on a strict diet,that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit,that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan!
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi!

Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?
Mastermind, my 6th LP
Can't believe we did it
Man, I thank everybody that played a part of this
Shout out to my engineer E-Mix
Each and every one of you supporters
My fans,100[Hook: Future &amp; Drake]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she's on a strict diet,that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit,that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan!
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi!



[Verse 3: Lil Wayne] (x2)
[Hook]
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating

[Intro: Lil Wayne &amp; Chris Brown]
YOUNG MULA BAAAAY-BAY!(Let me see)
Haha, you thought it was over?(Let me see)


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain’t right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain’t have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart
When she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch your inch
When she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time,I’m the shit, oh
Nigga, that’s that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)


[Hook: Chris Brown]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain’t loyal
These hoes ain’t loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Bridge: Chris]
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga’s bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don’t fuck with broke bitches


[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the Bob Marley I’m a Rasta
She wanna do drugs (drugs) smoke weed, get drunk (wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers (uh-huh)




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let’s get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That’s a no-no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance





[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
HAH! Once Cirocs in the system
Ain’t no telling will I fuck them, will I diss them
That’s what they be yelling, I’m a pimp by blood
Not relation, I don’t chase em, I replace em (HAH!)
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes, ain’t loyal, man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in the Lotus
She was riding in that hoopty (WHOOP!)
Fuck that bitch

Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on
Montana


[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl

Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin’?

You done spent your bread on her
And it’s all for nothing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Hook]
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know, I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho
Got witches all in my broom closet,got little killers in Chuco
We’ll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don’t name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy


[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes lazy
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know


[Verse 3]
Like where the fuck did my heart go , and show me something I haven’t seen
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been, but not to where I’ll never be
And I ain’t never scared but I’m scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies  big letter B , need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine

[]


[Verse 4]
Tell me something I don’t know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready,my family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots,I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic,nigga give me credit... on my balance
Lil Tunechi
Stand up niggas
(And I bump my head when I stand up)[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This is for the hood,this is for the ghetto
This is for the niggas getting that money
That cash money,that 100 million dollar money
We got money
We the best


[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' big, gettin' mine
Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy
We ridin' low,gettin' high
80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4'sI'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind,another one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money


I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
[Hook: Dre]
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto


[Verse 2: Birdman]
Everyday a new whip homie,So you know I gets my shine on
Flip after we flip homie,So you know I gets my grind on
Birdman daddy,Pullin up in the brand new Cadi

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums
There's money out here, we just trying to get some
Cool like Dre nigga,A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
Cuz them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G
Sounds like another co-defendant to me
Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
Fuck around and get everybodyindicted
Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
Fuck around go dead broke trying to fight it


[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I, I, I all night it, I every day it
And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
I wish I would switch, I don't know how
Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
Mean mug, like I can't smile
Like my grill didn't, Cost me a 100 thou

I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

We on the grind and our nuts got bigga
And every day we in the mothafuckin hood our guns got bigga
Stuntin on them niggas, gettin’ money stayin' fly every day a nigga spendin’
Ridin’ 25’s and we blazin’ gettin’ high, nigga showin’ off his ride
Cruisin’ through the beach nigga rollin’ in them bimmers

Know I got the money (laws won’t leave me alone)
Now they actin funny ‘cause they know a nigga strong
Money long and we comin’




[Hook x2]
[Lil Wayne]
I ain’t have to touch a piece of work since ‘94
I lost my daddy in ‘96 and started makin’ moves
In ‘98 (i got a brand new Lexus coupe)
(now them laws won’t leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone
I leave a house with a pocket full of stones
Got them hoes slangin’, hidin’ packs in they titties
Them small chest bitches gotta put it in their butt
(20s in them they can’t fuck wit us)
I got so many hoes
(it’s to the flow or I don’t see, don’t know)
(now they won’t leave me alone)
Man I got so much dough
(it’s to the flow or I don’t see, don’t know)
(now they won’t leave me alone)
Weezy baby d boy




And I ain’t touch a mothafuckin ki since ‘04
And that’s the word that we servin’, look that’s all we know
Them niggas talkin’ shit but we the niggas wit the cash flow
(i still smoke that weed, smoke that smoke that smoke that weed)
And I’m back on the beach and we blowin out the whole beat

Gangsta like a mothafucka me and my homies

442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
I'm rollin' past that BMW
That new shit pretty, these old-schools move
I ride city-to-city, my motor fine-tuned
I've got your girl with me, she so unfollowed you
I'm a paper on paper mission, caper to count the loot
We super fly fishin' with Yachts and Gucci shoes
Started with no pot to piss in, now I smoke pot and kick it
Beautiful stranger bitches trying to get more familiar
New Orleans know I feel 'em, wherever I go, I bring 'em
Real niggas in the building, smoked out any whip I've driven
Only focus is gettin' in the door, so we ripped it
Up off the fuckin' hinges like: "Where's the dope? We know it's in here"
Hoes already told us, give it here
Fuck them, we ball, so high, on this motherfuckin' jet
Check my rhymes, I ain’t told a lie yet, nigga


[Hook: Curren$y]
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
We comin' through, convertibles and coupes
My OG told me, "Smash anything in front you"
442, 442
I'm burnin' gas like a 442
Convertibles and coupes
If it's 'bout that cash, there's no tellin' what we'll do


[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money to the ceiling
Pimpin' is a gift I opened way too early
Like my, hair curly, redbone curvy
Make 'em run from this dick Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Alright, lipstick on my boxers, these pills fuck up my posture
Quick frankly I'm Sinatra, I'm shark and you tilapia
I've got shooters on payroll, but I grab my binoculars
I'm lookin' for my reason to tell my shooters I don't need 'em
Alright, revenge taste better than pussy
Man, ain't got no purple, gotta get it from Whoopi
I'mma put it in your mouth, I don't know how else to put it
I bet they ain't fuckin' with me, where's the bookie
Alright, I'm a motherfucker, quote-un-quote
She ride this dick like it came off the showroom floor
Lil' Tunechi aka No Baking Soda,I'm high, Lamar Odom
I'm smokin' like a motor




We poppin' off
We get to stuntin', you know it's bang or ball
Rollin' off, slidin' free shopping spree we clear them streets
Third wall, we bend them niggas
Reppin' mines to the end, my nigga
High life, we can't fake [?] so we'll show them niggas
Take they bitches, bring 'em home
Stunna holla, bang and ball
Layin' low in my old school
Top back for my old cool
Gave them niggas fresh game stay fly in that Bentley Coupe
Told my bitch how to get this money
Showed a bitch how to get this money
Pimpin' hoes, we pimp this game
Got the money, we kept on runnin'
Hard top and that new school
Drop top and that new school
Roof wide open nigga out the pound with them big tools
What up five? We in this jungle

What up five? We shine and hustle

Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up

Getcha baby kidnapped and ya baby-mother fucked
It's tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? you can't get on my level
You would need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you bout to suck my dick, bitch!
Swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
2 more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor I could have died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra I'm up like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me,bitch, watch me
Bitch watch me! But they cannot see me
Like Hitler, it's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby,yeah we right here
I'mma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss Citain a better place
When I was 14 I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I say
I told my girl "when you fuck me, better fuck me good
Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott
Fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin' everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watching

I never read 'em, weak bitch probably get seasick
On the yacht eat shrimp,see my name on a blimp
It read T-Raww's a pimp
Nigga I ain't dancin' but my hand on my hip
Full clip, movie shit, Bruce Wayne, Alfred
Niggas want a verse, can't even get a ad-lib
I'm killing this shit, and I'm killing your mind
One verse at a time, the shivers are mine
I murdered this shit, just takin' my time
Got bars, front gate, face shot, blind date
Rolex, timepiece, ain't got no time for no bitch speech
120 that six speed, pull it out that's all me
Just call me T-papi

Tunechi over bitches
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Smokin' color purple, blunt fat as Oprah Winfrey
I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, the nigga, nigga
I be snappin', I hope you get the bigger picture
I said fuck that nigga that you fuckin'
She say that nigga rap, I say he couldn't wrap a mummy
But let me pass the weed, and stop passin' judgement
Before I have to beat him like a dick he had it comin'
Been eating so much pussy, man I'm starting to get chubby
Schoolin' motherfuckers, I'm their favorite subject
Broomstick in my pants, I'm 'bout to go witch hunting
I'm already loaded, these niggas still bufferin'
I fuck my girlfriend and her best friend,these niggas is lesbians
Don't cross me like a pedestrian,I'm getting head watching ESPN
She holdin' me and carressin' me
Don't hate the player, hate the referee
If she F with me, I am definitely a necessity

[Hook]
[Baby]
Nigga can't out-stunt me when it come to these fuckin' cars, nigga
Believe that!

You know me - I don't need no introduction and shit

Arm hangin', wrist blingin' - just stun'n and shit
Drop the top, block is hot
Stay bumpin', ya bitch
B. Atriceget it right,don't tangle and twist it
Hit the club every night, drunk - drinkin' that Crissy
Niggas mad - don't like it cause I'm bangin' they bitches
When the light hit the ice, it twankle and glistens
Baby, Brian, B, Bubba - you can call me what you feel
Hoppin' out the platinum Hummer with the platinum grill
With the platinum pieces, and the platinum chains
With the platinum watches, and the platinum rings(platinum rings)
Nigga shit ain't changed, still doin' my thing
Still do it for the block - nuts hang and swing
You don't know another nigga that can stunt like me (stunt like me)
Big Tymer representin', nigga -the U.P.T

(Hook [Baby + Lil' Wayne])

Juvie 'bout to hold the rocks, nigga, hook it up
Diamonds on my hoes' feet- when they walk, they spark
Diamonds in my fuckin' teeth- when I talk, I spark
Don't fuck around with beef - when it start, I spark
Me and my Hot Boy creeps - when it's dark, we spark
Just bought a new car, and I spent about a million
The motherfuckin' driver seat sittin' in the middle
Me and my sonWeezy got a house by the water
I'll be fuckin' bad bitches (bad bitches, bad bitches)


[Lil' Wayne]

[Baby {talking}]
Monte Carlo, that's hot and on fire

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up,you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall: outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin,peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell


[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream,hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun,Son of Sam,you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech,I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch,I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to,I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown,thoroughbred,a BX nigga,ya heard?Gunna[Hook: Jim Jones]
I'm all about that motherfucking paper ho
This song goes out to all my money making hoes
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket, top back when I lean
I pull up in that motherfucking Phantom Ghost
This song goes out to all my niggas getting dough
60 rackz in my pocket, 60 rackz in my jeans
60 rackz in my pocket top back when I lean


[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
60 racks thats no dough, mattes fact thats ho dough
I made that when I transported, back and forth taking Nodoze
Rolex rose gold,my neck so cold
She seen't that quarter chill,V in black, quarter mill
We don't shop at saveraux,60 thou for the roll
Drop top foreign flow, this is not affordable
Wrist cold, caught the flu, Cartier said quarter to
She sucked my dick, swallowed it, my watch still said quarter to
Dipset, Young Money, niggas know that that money grown
Wanna talk to me, you better talk to me, from that pool deck of my summer home (Can't hear you niggas)
My summer home, pool deck with like a hundred on
Who's a threat? Got a pool net, and my jewels wet like a thunderstorm




Swear to God I go so hard, they call me Tunechi fuck 'em all
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Can't pack no gun, so I keep a knife like that fuckin' Chucky doll
I'm at your neck like a shawl, on your ass like some drawers
I got 3 hoes with me, fuck, I look like Santa Claus
And I got bad bitches all over me, real niggas that roll with me
And we get off weight like that one bitch from Floetry
Got a pair of pants with 4 pockets, 15K in each of 'em
Do the math you mo'fucka,I'm on my Robin Leach, blood
Skating with my homeboys, talking shit smoking weed
I oversee everything, niggas call me overseas
Young mulah mothafucka, click clack boo ya, mothafucka
60 rackz in my pocket, try to jack and get bodied
Young Tunechi




I got an ill gift, I'm real swift, they be like, "Damn, he still rich"
When I send my men in black listen none of them niggas is will smith
I sell coke, I deal piff, when I ride by in that black on black
Ménage à trois with two double D's, come to see that's racks on racks
They ship it in, I give it to ya on the ground or in the air
They drop it off,[Hook]
[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
they're like LeBron in the 4th quarter, I give it there
I be me, you be you, apologies to Groovie Lou
Sorry, brah, I ain't fuckin' with mase, yea yea tell 'em you be cool
Me I rep that Hud 6,I ain't even gon' play with 'em
Harlem Underworld for real,you can fool Wale and them
The MAC, well, that's black on black, true fact I'm crack on tracks
Play around, and I'll lay you down, 60 racks in your cap, nigga

[Hook: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I’m easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin, when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated, I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground


Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
[Verse 1: Drake]
Spades or the Opus, baby, what you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things,have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes - miwacles
Yeah, ok, they say that I'm the one, in fact
Some say that I'm their favourite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I’m about my team, ho, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar,where the fuck is Stunna at?
Damn


Untouchable[Verse 2: Birdman]
40 with my AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind,flipping money in every way
Headline, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Don P,Marc Jacobs gloves
Cartier Louiscase with a dope plod
From the mud where they what you leave in your blood
Going in, flipping hundreds get the young plug
Show ‘em where it go
Floating on the floor, getting more dough
Grind hard, go, black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond minks, fur, February snow




[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, you know you paid when you got Baby with ya
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I’m a lady twister I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit - blisters
Sticking to the script: movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I’m a big smoker, I’m a little drinker
My peace sign is just the trigger and the middle finger
Wha-what you know about it, man ya’ll clueless
I let two women ride me, that's car-poolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building then we are intruders
Simmer down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game - analyst
Man I’m the shit, And y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
What y'all know about five of the hottest young niggas in the game
Bow Wow, Short Dawg, Scrappy
The boy Lil' Wayne, the homie Pimp C
We got a little story to tell y'all bout where we come from


[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
Mouth cost more than your house,house on ten acres
And the inside so fly niggas call me Jim Baker
From Ohio to Texas, we're so infectious
A-T-L to S-T-L it's gon' be hard to catch us
I'm talking bout bills sipping on bar
Drinking crunk, living like there's no tomorrow
See out-of-towners can't understand, cause I cut all my words short
Popping Texas, mandatory, Saturday at the mall
Hoods ain't hoods, they called wars and zones
Guns cart choppers and when it's on, it's on
See the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, hear me out
Said the kids can't live without it, ain't nothing you can do about it
Learn how to bounce or get out it, now answer me this


Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise


The boy country like overalls you know that dawg
Catch me in the slab, the same color as Bubu's rust
Cruising up the Ave and I'm probably gon give yo' ho a call
Cuz I ball hard and I'm stuntin' like there's no tomorrow
So yesterday, I swear I spent about fifty G's
On a wristwatch that shine brighter that a Christmas tree
If you was getting cheese, you would probably spend it, too
So don't hate me cause I blow paper like the wind do
And hop out clean, so watch out, Queen
[Hook x4: Pimp C]
[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
I'm getting money maine, so my pockets hella chubby
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea




They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
And I ain't gon run a gang of gorillas that love to fight
I'm the Iceman, I'm far away from the sun
But I'm still hot like a bullet pushing up out a gun
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
You passed another drink and I'm sipping another one
You trust me with the blunt and I'm blowing myself a blunt
Got a Fruit Loop Coupe looking like orange juice
When them niggas see the troop, they don't be knowing what to do
Yea I'm Scrap, greatest young nigga in the nation
Y'all niggas quit hating on the money that I'm making
I'm just country




Look they call me Wayne, dirty south chaperone
So far ahead in the race, I don't know which lap I'm on
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
[Hook x4]
[Verse 3: Lil' Scrappy]
[Refrain]
[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
Am I the illest doing this? Hell yeah
I am fresher than the Prince of Bel-Air
And OG kush I what you smell here
Smoking the biggest blunts, don't worry I brought a spare
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
I put ice all over the Audemar
Piguet watchface, now time is hard to tell
And I will do whatever The Carter shall
So hot, going out with me is like going to hell

[Refrain]
[Hook x2: Akon]
I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tool on deck - why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy - hope ya got 9 lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
Country ass boy - country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil' Weezyana
Errbody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill popping animal - Syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 gimme brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho - hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her
Her name is 9 millimeter



[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Banner]
If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes




[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a west coast original,black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa,I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

[Hook x2]
[Intro: Cassidy]
Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggas with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Aiyyo Wheezy let's get it poppin!


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hit me,Fuck that shit this the south side
Got a fat dick when your mouth wide,I'm from the take it outside
Nah do it right here, nah, how 'bout later on
Yeah when everybody home
Look, you fucking with Weezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch, got keys on the lady
Triple gold D's Vogue tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out, I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like "Usher" but worser
If there's any beef, I come Ron like Mercer
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into Sherbert
I got flow I'm like "Sure" but
If it's about dough, I'm like "Sure 'nuff"
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggas bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wrist moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires where the package is gone
Midas been a Goodyear with these Firestones
I spit like Maya's poems,palming chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got soma's
I got vicodins, valiums I ain't stopping
Got powder, heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping?
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money, nigga, I'm that shit
Weezy Baby


[Interlude: Cassidy]
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggas
And let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you


[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You're goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur, no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggas must've got a deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue-collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And 20 dime bitches, to show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look
The boy's got at least 6 digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like 10 bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The 2 grand 20's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship, I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting, I'm fine
I'ma have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the 9
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts, no, not the penmanship
The box-office shit, I box off this bitch
Jessica Alba,Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til their family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'ma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations


[Cassidy: Interlude]
Yeah it is what it is
My niggas just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket


[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I'm tryin' not to let this industry get the best of me, y'all
I work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood, they're respecting me y'all
And even overseas, they're accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money, so expect me to ball
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars, but success is my destiny, y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe, y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me, y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me, y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me, y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me, y'all
Screaming, "Cass you don't know how sexy you are!"
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday, but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday, so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying "What's up"
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up
Prraat prraat.I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggas will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave
That's why, even if it's petty, I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola
I pop the Ruger, send that hot shit through ya
Like booya, that's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But, man, niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing, believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga, I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga, I'm that shit
Bitch[Intro]

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It’s Lil Tunechi,what up doe?

Hard dope, call it HDFlat screen
Fuck outta here, your shit water whipped
You got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave 'em dead in the living room
Get it? Leave 'em dead in the living room
Fuck all these niggas and tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head and tell the nigga to have a blast
Fuck you mean I’m talking keys like Ray Charles
Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8 balls




Soft white, I got that G-mix
I'm going gold, crumbs to the bricks
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Bitch I'm blowing up like napalm
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL

Act a ass wit it, back ya ass with it


[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You know them hoes love Weezy, say he cute, small, long hair, big dick
Weezy bring to y'all,don't y'all lip quit
Put your lips on this dick,let me get on some livin'
Spit all over ya chin, Weezy be on some pimp shit
I see 'em, peep 'em, meet 'em, beep 'em, later on if she ride
G 'em, freak 'em, by the weekend she be fuckin' the squad
I ain't got no loves for broads, I ducks and dodge
I grab 'em on their butts and all
She fucks my dog, slut sucks nuts and all, and nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes defensive linemen, cause they rush the balls
Let Weezy bust they jaws
Never have no picks and chooses, I hits and lose 'em
And go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl to thug with me
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks don't wanna fuck wit me



[Hook: Lil Wayne &amp; B.G]
[Lil Wayne]
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall ho
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit it

A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some
Tear that dick down bitch, start all over again
And bungee jumpin'

Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it


That's right, act a fool bitch,[B.G.]
[Both]
[Verse 2: B.G]
do what you do, ho
After I finish, don't get up, gotta let Weezy go
You get your props your pussy fire, girl you a pro
So when I'm speakin' I'm creepin' and come get some mo'
You better recognize, you better realize
This is the nigga Geezy, I ain't nothin' nice
Love when you reach out, grab, stuff it straight your mouth
Start suck it 'til that middle come out
Ride me (ride me), put that dick inside you (inside you)
After that wiggle your ass and make that juice move
I'm a donkey,better yet a veteran
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The Number 1 Stunna, Baby he raised me
Pump in my head - never let a bitch play me
Always get the tec nigga fuck 'em all
Wrap a chain 'round ya neck and walk it like a dog




See now when Lil Wayne put that dick down, biznites can't even walk or even sit down
Wipe your mouth off and let me hit now
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
That Rum got me feelin' real good
The dick hard like real wood
I put it in slow and work it real good
This Lil nigga have a lot a sex, so do me slow, get out the Prada dress
Come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm on blast ma', why you take it slower than its fast time
Flip ya back over, make that ass right
Weezy make ya suck it then taste, that's how the pimp play
Make her friend eat me and this bitch up like shrimp plates
Bounce in the club rollin' on X, eyes pitch black
I got 2 more 'nites is you wit that
Fuck it let's go, when we pop out Lil Moe
Drop the top part of the 'Dro
Later on I'm touchin' the throat, bare wit it
Where them hot girls that like that nasty shit
Make them act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it

[Hook]
[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Young desperado, straight out the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga, but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga, I've been getting my share in like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio
I started high with two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts; cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away, like "Later dudes"
Never get caught, baby, I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no Asian food
I wet up the party, so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga


[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... keep talking that shit that you talking
And we gone have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't you forget.. I know ya, you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... fall back


[Verse 2 - Fat Joe]
Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the binky, splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it, it's nothing to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got your back, whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levees
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga... how you want it huh coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you running naked like an old school
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it,and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal army
And I'm a rider homie, and you can find it on me
That 40 cal'll get your shirt picture ironed on it
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas wanting war but they runnin' from me...Crack!




[Hook - Lil Wayne]
[Verse 3 - Birdman]
I had 'em as lil' niggas, raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' with them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceiling, me and my young nigga chilling
I'm in the streets, hustling, getting money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga,got some new tools
Nigga got some more jewels, we was getting money
And ain't nothing ever changed, still doing the thang
Still getting money, still spending change
We hustling from Sunday to Sunday
And we grinding everyday like the money ain't coming
Nigga... yeah we riding woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thing
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em Idda split they fuckin' wig
3rd Ward let me claim my fame
I put it down, Uptown, I'mma do my thang believe that

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
[Hook]
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker


[Bridge]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking 'bout abortion


[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue




[Hook] + [Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared




[Bridge]
[Verse 3]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Hook]
