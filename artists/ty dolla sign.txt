I got a bad light skin from the Valley
She be in the club with no panties
Little bitch, she used to be my favorite
But now we don’t speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
From my dark skin, least know how to take it
I got em both the same damn red bottoms
And bought 'em both the same damn fragrance
Both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches can stay over
Both of my bitches look good as fuck
Your bitch look like boogawolf




[Hook]
[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'
I’ve been smoking, I’ve been sippin'

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
I got a Spanish bitch, her name Miha
See all my bitches is bad, I’m not T.I
Ain’t no Tinys around me, uh uh bitch
The only thing I got is a long dick
Two of my women conceited,like Mike I beat it

And when I pull out that penis, she like "woah!"
She got a truckfull of ass I gotta tow
See all my niggas is ballin', we got dough
I got a car full of bitches, see I’m a pro
See it be two for me, I'mma pass the rest
Soon as they pass the test I put dick on they breast
I came on their chest, ain’t no cuff when we fuckin
If the muffin be bluffin I get to actin’ like Ruffin

Yo, nice to meet you

[Hook: Quavo]
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
Splash, drip, islands
Water, islands
Splash, drip drip, lots of islands
Living on the islands


[Verse 1: Quavo]
On the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game,wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my fleet
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my fleet?
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my fleet?
POW!




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got dreads like I'm from the islands
Smokin' weed like I'm from the islands
I just met a bad light-skinned bitch on Highland
I'ma get some brand new pussy tonight
Dolla Sign and Migos we the trendsetters
Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
That's yo' bitch, on God, she was just with us
That's yo' bitch, tonight, nigga don't kiss her
Rum and coke, she drink piña colada
I only smoke kush, these niggas still on the chronic
Met a red bone, in bikini bottoms
Look just like Rihanna, say she from the islands




My bitch from the islands I covered her in diamonds
The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it !
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him

Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross


[Verse 4: Offset]
Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game,wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my fleet
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my fleet?
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my fleet?
POW!




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got dreads like I'm from the islands
Smokin' weed like I'm from the islands
I just met a bad light-skinned bitch on Highland
I'ma get some brand new pussy tonight
Dolla Sign and Migos we the trendsetters
Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
That's yo' bitch, on God, she was just with us
That's yo' bitch, tonight, nigga don't kiss her
Rum and coke, she drink piña colada
I only smoke kush, these niggas still on the chronic
Met a red bone, in bikini bottoms
Look just like Rihanna, say she from the islands




My bitch from the islands I covered her in diamonds
The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it !
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I'm a young rich nigga
I'm buying whatever no matter the cost
Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross


[Verse 4: Offset]
Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

[Hook 1: Ty$ (Fabulous)]
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I hate to see a broke bitch flashin'
Chanel bag that she never keep cash in
Hate when bitches try to put you in the friend zone
Bitch I'm tryna score put me in the end zone
Hate to see a thick bitch on Instagram
And the bitch show up looking like a Teddy graham (I don’t follow)
Flat butt, fat gut, thirst bucket, that’s what
Type of shit that I hate, I let a thirsty ho dehydrate
Backward ass bitch, do a good nigga bad
‘Sposed to keep you happy, they just make a nigga mad
Nosy ass hoes, I hate ‘em
Always finding shit but can’t find a man to date them, huh

Yeah, type of shit that I hate
Woah, that’s the type of shit that I hate
Woah, that’s the type of bitch that I hate

Say that she mine but that's a lie

These hoes don't be loving these niggas
Really we all just want the money

I'm fully paid, got a young face when I'm fully shaved(oh, oh, oh)
I like Griffey, my dad favorite would be Willie Mays
You get in the game be true to it
They say that I got a lot of hoes but I was used to it
Thinking 'bout her body and what I would do to it(oh, oh, oh)
Looking at the stars, getting head, I call that moonroof
She said "I can't fuck with you Dom cause you too stupid" (oh, oh, oh)
Used to love Death Row and I used to love Ruthless
Talking 'bout the Westside, right there on Crenshaw (oh, oh, oh)
Back in '93 everybody was from Lench Mob
Girls ain't groupies, most these niggas are(oh, oh, oh)
Stop buying Jordans, save up, you should get a car
Buy you a laptop, buy you a saxophone(oh, oh, oh)
I got a clean bed, me and you can get nasty on
She love it when I talk dirty

And life's a bitch so I had to pimp it
I went from water with a lemon straight to lavish livin'
Fashion's trend: exchange numbers with the baddest women
I couldn't wear a suit and tie and get a average pension
Cause niggas like me would always have detention (oh, oh, oh)
But niggas like me always had ambitions
Of being free in this cold world (oh, oh, oh)
It's just a couple real niggas left and my homegirls
It's real shit right there (oh, oh, oh)
Watch my old videos, I still sit right there
Ran with my clique right there (oh, oh, oh)
First fist fight, I bust my lip right there
I'm just yo' chick type, yeah (oh, oh, oh)
She probably nod her head like "This my shit right here"
Now, I got my game from the Dogg Pound (oh, oh, oh)
So if she know me, then I probably took them draws down
I got 4 cars now (oh, oh, oh)
I took the 6-4 cause she like they way the car sound
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school
All I do is press a button just to start the coupe
Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count
Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out
If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?
If they say money talks, then my dollars shout
Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist
Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick
Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box
Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks

Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You could find me at the shooter range, practicing bussin' gats
Or in the vocal booth, in this new studio, bussin' raps
With some gold on my body, out my body, off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Love to get naughty,a hottie, up in the lobby, she stopped me
She said "40 Water, where you 'bout to be?"

Sounding like a motherfucking summer jam
Fat bank roll, my pockets pregnant

Pull up to the scene in a all black ghost

‘Cus forever is usually better
But forever is usually never
‘Cus I ain’t fuckin with that bitch
She says she got a man but that really don’t mean shit

God bless yo body like I sneeze on it
Everything just my type
Ain’t tryna recycle no lines but don’t waste no mo time

Let me squeeze on that booty like a ruger

Waiting til headliners open up til then I'm yosted up
Smoking the most potent blunt with the homies
And my main thang under my arm, but she ain't the only one
