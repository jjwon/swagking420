[Chorus]
Emergency, Emergency
There’s a black tar cloud all because of me
Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)


(Tell ‘em the truth)
You’re packing up quickly the baby’s at Grandmas
The raging coast is far from clear (truth)
You’re yelling and screaming and smacking me
How could you do this you spoiled little rich kid (truth)
A rock in the TV
You bashin' my ride up, you smashed my guitar
(Tell ‘em the truth)
Chasing me around the house swinging trying to hit me with my favorite golf club (truth)
You revved up the car
You smashed through the gate
I ran up the street (truth)
I waited an hour to cool off
When I came back it was too late (truth)

You were lying in bed (truth)
Said you took twenty pills (truth)
Now I’m calling the ambulance, police, I’m freakin' out till you said chill Baby I didn't really take them pills
I’m just desperately crying for help


(911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)
Aww emergency (911) yeah Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)


(Tell ‘em the truth)
I was licking your wounds
I thought we were straight (truth)
I thought everyone was gonna eat the chips
Turns out I’m the only one who double dipped (truth)
Face down in a puddle of shame (tell ‘em the truth)
Drowning in suffering, self-sabotaging
The one thing that always made life seem ok (truth)
I was jealous of your light, jealous of your soul
Good morning manipulation and control




One heart was more than enough
One body wanted too much (truth)
One kiss it wanted to stay
One hand always misbehaved
(Tell ‘em the truth)
One eye looked around the room
One eye looked inside itself and finally (truth)
Finally saw the truth yeah
(Finally the truth)
Finally saw the truth
(Finally the truth)
Now the sun’s is going down yeah the sun’s going down
Ana all we got left baby is this black tar, black tar, black tar cloud

Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud all cause of me me me me me me me
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
Can’t see through the clear (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar) in both hemispheres (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar) and I brought it here (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
Oh emergency (911)[Verse 1]

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
We are at war with the universe.The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now is sensitivity and compassion.But I know one thing's for sure.I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down


[Verse 1]
Some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn


[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
I work at the corner store, we all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low, no one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone, we're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more,we just can't overcome, no


[Hook: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?


[Verse 2]
I knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around the lucks all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer, let's pray


These friends they come and go but I got family, family
[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
These kids so fast they grow, they learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go, that there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low and we can't overcome, no




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And you're next, so try they can't steal your pride it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining, I know


[Outro]
Yeah, born right here in the USA. But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee.So accept my emotion. Do not take it as an offensive gesture.It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me. We got spirit y'all, we got spirit. We got soul y'all, we got soul. They don't want us to see, but we already know[Intro: Thicke]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You’re like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can leave a dick loved
Now you gettin' this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby, this pedestrian
Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!)go get me a burner
Got shot like (boom!)
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You’re cotton candy, I need a fistful
I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you


Hey, girl
You know you're lookin' so damn fly
You lookin' like you fell from the sky (Angel)
You know you make a grown man cry

I wanna give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby
I'll make it so, so, so amazing
I'll give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
If you can't hear what I'm trying to say
If you can't read from the same page
Maybe I'm going deaf
Maybe I'm going blind
Maybe I'm out of my mind


[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature
Just let me liberate you
You don't need no papers
That man is not your maker
And that's why I'm gon' take a


[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Good girl
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You're a good girl
Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic
Talk about getting blasted
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me


[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
What do they make dreams for
When you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for
You the hottest bitch in this place
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey!






[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hustle Gang Homie
One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'


[Breakdown: Robin Thicke]
Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work
Hey!


[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
Baby, can you breathe
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur
No more pretending
Cause now you're winning
Here's our beginning
I always wanted a




Everybody get up

[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light

(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)

(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriend sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight


I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small
I never should’ve asked you to do anything at all
I should’ve kissed you longer
I should’ve held you stronger
[Verse 1]
And I’ll wait for forever for you love me again




Oh it’s so hard (it’s so hard)
Oh it’s so hard (Oh it’s so hard)
[Hook]
[Bridge]
But it doesn’t have to be

Cause ...
[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1]
I knew when I laid my eyes on you
The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was fly
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain’t even 20 baby
I ain’t learned to love you right yet
Good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind


[Hook]
For theof myyou know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine


[Verse 2]
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang "Forever My Lady" and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn’t even old enough to drive a
I saw my only chance to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do

[Hook]
[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)

(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)

(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriend sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight


I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small

Ain't no hat 4 that


Some say that your behavior is preposterous
You’re just an imaginary friend
[Verse 1]
Dangerous to my pursuit of happiness
Trouble’s bound to get me in the end


[Hook]
You got your cure for anxious
You got your pill for bad
But your fancy shoes and handbag
Can’t help you when you’re sad
Cause There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that
There ain’t no hat for that
Ain’t no hat for that


[Verse 2]
Some say her temperament’s obstreperous
She’s only nice when something is at stake
And speaking for her friends there is a cost to us
We pay the price for riding in that wake




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Shopping for your superficial treasures
Stopping short of offering your heart
Stranger to the simplest of pleasures
Distance is to you a work of art




Ain’t no hat for that

Life can leave a dick loved
Now you gettin' this dick, love

No injection, I learned my lesson

Runnin' through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy like pop, go give me a burner
Got shot like pop
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You're cotton candy, I need a fistful
I'm often antsy, hope that convince you

The lights from above seemed to shine on only you
And you made me feel like I was fly
When I made you sparkle in your eyes
We ain’t even 20 baby
I ain’t learned to love you right yet
Good thing I thought I was the shit back then
I sang in your ear cause I wanted you to know
That I had soul baby
I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind


[Hook]
For theof myyou know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine


[Verse 2]
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang "Forever My Lady" and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn’t even old enough to drive a
I saw my only chance to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do

Yes, you should be afraid
Yes, you should be afraid, baby


They in the bushes, look in the trees
They got they red laser sniper rifles stuck on me
Creepin' up slow, ducking down real close
They gonna huff and puff and knock down the doo
Come on now


Well, let's get it started
Load the gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now, I'm heavily armed
I got an angel on each arm

I got that, an angel on each arm, baby
Alright now
You know I got that one on my left, come on
One on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night
I got that


I saw it so clear, two hearts flying in my mirror
Then I knew good things were gonna come, now
A fortune teller, she read my palm
She said hard times will soon be over
Good times will come




Yes, you should afraid
I said yes, you should be afraid
Cause I come for everyone
No lies, no regrets
No denial, no empty bets
Just the truth as I am, alright now



I got the bullet with your name on it
Best be afraid of it
Cause I'm coming for you, baby
Don't try to stop me
I'm coming to get you


I got an angel on each arm, yeah, alright, yeah

Hey girl, I've been thinking
About you in see-through secrets
Crawling on my thousand-thread count down, down, down
Play, play hard to get as you know I love to chase that
Till you push me on the bed and start your show


Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you
Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you


[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Lay, lay across my pillow, as you make love to me ego
And you always treat me like a superstar
Oh, I'm so obsessed, you know I'm such a mess
When I see you get undressed and start your show




I'm all tied up
(And I get so locked up inside)
I'm all tied up
([Hook]
[Bridge]
All I need is you and you got the key baby
Only you can release me)

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Ok, now he was close
Tried to domesticate you
But you're an animal
Baby, it's in your nature

Good girl

But you're a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me


[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]

Hustle Gang Homie
One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'


[Breakdown: Robin Thicke]
Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work
Hey!

It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur
No more pretending

Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed


[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I was over played like Mike Jackson hits
I swear them Growing Pains was Alan Thicke.
Now we’re crying less and we’re smiling
High of life and we wilding
I just pray that I don’t OD before the league, Len Bias
Sending thank you's to my old teachers, who told me I was dreaming
Cause now I’m in the Aston Martin Luther King, speeding.
And the bad bitch, my cargo, I’m so fueled, that’s are code
By the niggers who trying to stop are go
Now we’re American Idols like a Fox show
I remember waiting all in line, in line
Now the legends ask me can I make time, make time.
So you should look up, be proud of this nigger
Pop your face, just smile for a nigger
For the people that used to front middle fingers up, fuck you very much


Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, it’s all I ever dreamed


[Hook]
[Verse 2: Price Tag]
I remember having a dream with the world in my palm
Now I just copped a new crib, gave the keys to my mom.
Since I signed with John Janick, yeah, I think I’m Lebron
Think I’m Bin Laden, that mean I think I’m the bomb
'We'd never make it here', that’s what they told us
Now we’re burning cause we earn it, so what?
Club full of white girls with no butt
They wanna smoke, I told her ‘Marilyn Monroell up’
For a nigger who ain’t never had nothing
Who came up from the bottom and made it to the top
To a nigger getting ends, no rims on a Benz, rich nigger could you stop
Now we getting cake, anime, we getting cake, anime
Them cold nights we used to pray, now it’s cold ice, open up the Ace




I heard a gang a niggers got fired,[Hook]
[Verse 3: Oktane]
Wayne about to retire,
And on everybody’s top five Oktane getting higher
I do it one time for my haters, and ya'll know who you are
These niggers hating my guts, cause I got mine customized in my car, let’s go
Now Hit-Boy said it best, 'we're just all young and excited'
With the cripple women you would kill for
Just dying to be invited, then they want us, we don’t need them
You never did this, don’t believe them
Put your cellphone on that table
And keep your hands where I can see them,girl
They lying if they say this party ain’t everything that it seems
Making music that we love, laying on top of the girl of your dreams
I just hit her door,I knock-knock
Make her hit the floor, then stop, drop
Now your favorite model I got screaming




We get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigger
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
We’re gonna get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigger
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed[Hook]
[Bridge: K. Roosevelt]
[Verse 1]
Why would I go to Rome,or stand in St. Peter's Square?
Or gaze at Mona Lisa with someone who can't compare?
I'd never go without, I wouldn't even dare
Like Rio De Janeiro was never even there
No need to spend my birthday with all of my friends in New York City
(Boring)
No need to have floor seats; seventh game Celtics and Kobe
(Boring)


You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring
You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring
You make me say "Glory, Hallelujah"; you're never boring


[Hook]
[Verse 2]
There's no need to go to Victoria Secret's show
Or stay in Central Bay on Jay and Beyoncé's boat
No supermodel or Obama could interest me mo'
It's like everything's meaningless without you close

So I put a ring on it and I married you
Come on and take a ride with me on a avenue
If you see it and you want it, you can have it boo
You have these other girls getting mad at you
Cause you got brains, looks and attitude
Cause my skill line is getting blurrier
I come home to my own Miss America
I mean this ain’t no ordinary love
Go and bring it here to my girl, hurry up
I'm watching, I'm waiting and they not you, so they hating
They just angry cause you ain't basic
And I'mma give you a standing ovation

[Hook]

Now that you're here

You're doin' the most, suga
So don't worry 'bout the situation
I'd never let you go


Can you handle it

You only want the best of my love
Now I can see that
There's only one way to tear it up
Yeah
I'm willing to tell you
Everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much

What about you babe
Will you tell me
All the freaky things you are
Before I do
Need you to know
If we make it through
Our love will grow
Oooh ho ho
Imagine how amazing things would be


Can you handle it

That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby
If I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly
The man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much

Uhhhhh
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself
Should I go there
Should I do it
Yeeeaaahhh oooooh
Can I give it to you fully
Can you handle it


Can you handle it
If I go there baby with you
We gon' lay it out
We gon' tear it up

[Verse 1]
Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down


But oh, I know, I know exactly how you feel


But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe?


See the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
Cause that's all I got


And oh, I know, when you're down at the bottom
Can you believe?




Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness
When nobody else believes?
Can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?




If nobody's watching
You will never know[Pre-Hook]

And I stole the moon
I raised the sunshine
And I've been the fool
And I have been laughed at
And I've been lied to
And I have been left alone with no answer


[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more


[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I took the picture
I faced the truth
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
And I watch you fall asleep smiling
And I lie awake
But there's only so much that one man can take


[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Ooo so I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this

Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

Ooooooooo

And I am a hero
But I'm not made of steel
And I'm not the smartest man
But I know the deal
And I'll bleed for your lips
If you'll bleed for mine
And I can't escape it
Cause I do love you


Ooo so I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more

I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me, I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
You're a lone hitchhiker, I'm a traveling truck
You better not get on this ride
You might lose your luck, I'm dangerous
You better heed the sign, the skull and cross bone nights
Stop lights in use, I'm slippery when wild
Cautions and red flags, I'm gonna cross that line
I'm dangerous


So don't you, don't you say maybe
Baby, I'm crazy, crazy for wanting
Wanting you badly
Madly I'm serious
And you're so curious
But I'm too dangerous


You better not kiss me once
You better not fall in love
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm a pterodactyl, and you're a wondering dove
I don't mean to be greedy, but it's never enough
I'm dangerous
I'll tell you I'll love you and I'll believe it's true
Oh, then I'll do something so bad to you
And you'll say "I hate you"
And you'll be screaming in a dream
Where no one can hear you




You're idealistic, so filled with glee
You see me as your shining prince
But I'm a treacherous king
You'll accept my olive branch, but I'm poison ivy


I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me, I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous[Hook]

You want your own spot, let's talk locations
Then talk market and the public relations

[Bridge: Robin Thicke](50 Cent)
Everybody's watching
But no one talks about it (shut your mouth)
Right now - that's all it was, anything call it
She said ''sex just ain't the same without it''




Every little step I take (come on) you will be there
Every little step I make (look, bitch) we'll be together
So grateful (yeah) so faithful (uhh)
Every gram in the hand's more paper (c'mon)
I'll cut it, you sniff it or smoke it, terrific


Movie stars, models and, blondes and cocaine
New York, L.A. is, all the same
The angels look the other way

The ice caps wouldn't be melting and neither would I
I would just drive my big old car, and everything would be alright
And energy would just fall down right from the sky, yeah

Words would fly right from out of my mind, out of my mind into your heart, into your life
And everything would sound just right, and no one would stop me from drinking my wine

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
My dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream, (dream)

For the real world just don't feel right
I wouldn't spend my days searching for, searching for lost time (ooh ooh, dream)
I wouldn't be so damn sensitive, I'd let things go by
No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change, I'd change with the time, yeah he

And every time I need a woman, she'd appear right by me
She hold me tight, treat me right, and tell me that everything is gonna be, is gonna be alright, alright

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld

I would tell Van Gogh that he was loved, there's no need to cry
I would say Marvin Gaye your father didn't want you to die(dream)
There would be no black and white, the world just treat my wife right
We could walk down in Mississipi and no one would look at us twice
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream[Verse 1]

I called you all the time
I guess I tried too hard to
You'd have nothing to do with me baby
Thank God that you changed your mind


[Hook]
For theof myyou know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life you know I wanna be yours
For the rest of my life for you I’m gonna be strong
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay
Baby will you stay mine


[Verse 2]
Finally convinced you to come over and just say hi
I sang "Forever My Lady" and kissed you for the very first time
After months, holidays, holding hands in the park
Normally I’d be playing basketball or something like that in the park
Then I messed up like boys tend to do
It’d be a year till I got back with you
Thank God that you called me back baby
Cause I’d never be the man that I am today




[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Then one night upon the phone
You said you were at home alone
I wasn’t even old enough to drive a
I saw my only chance to keep it alive
Keep love alive
Good thing for you I stole my daddy’s car
Cause no one’s ever gonna love you baby
Better than I do

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah... ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank y'all for comin' out tonight
It's my third album, third tour, third time's a charm


Girl when I go, where we go, I wanna take you 'round the globe with me
I got dough,  plenty baby you can blow with me
And baby I know that money ain't everything
But it's fo' sho' (fo' sho, fo' sho')
And ain't for nothin when you fuck, with, me
Now when I go


Follow my lead
Baby I can be all you need, if you follow my lead
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down, put your trust in me
Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead


[Intro: Robin Thicke]
[Hook: 50 Cent]
[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, "baby I apologize"
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?




After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Hook]
[Verse 2]
[Hook]
[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)

(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)

(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriend sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight


I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small
I never should’ve asked you to do anything at all
I should’ve kissed you longer
I should’ve held you stronger
[Verse 1]
And I’ll wait for forever for you love me again




Oh it’s so hard (it’s so hard)
Oh it’s so hard (Oh it’s so hard)
[Hook]
[Bridge]

You’re like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can leave a dick loved
Now you gettin' this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson

Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!)go get me a burner
Got shot like (boom!)

T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You’re cotton candy, I need a fistful
I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you
