I heard you trying to sing, do wanna sign a deal?
You wanna fall back, just take your time and chill
I be out in New Orleans like please believe me
If you really fucking with me say "Yeah" like Jeezy
Ooh yeah, you like that I like that too
She got kicked out the club I brought her right back through
I got the juice like that, I could get away with murder
And if you ain't knowing you should go ahead and learn it
Burn it, hot shit, cut it out like a surgeon
I'm splurgin' on fly shit 'til the day that they bury me




[Hook]
[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
My role model used to drive a Saab
Still got every chain I had from the start
Just a victim of identity theft
Them ho niggas ordered Victoria Secret cards
Finger your mom with a aged thumb
Money talk so I say sum'n, play sum'n
Why every time I do a feature, it feel like I ate sum'n?
Real shit, got the A locked
With my rollie on the west coast, call it bay watch, nigga
They watch, nigga,put it in a safe box, nigga
Put a fucking dread lock in her, hey!
Throw this money, the trap my habitat
Woke up with money, cause I went to sleep with racks,real shit




This is why you know I'm the man

And I'ma balling ass nigga bank with MaxPreps
Ooh yeah, I'm from Seven oh Seven
Used to be on Pintail from the 7-Eleven
You know she hold it down for a mac
She make it jump like I'm holding on an iPhone app
Like holla,give her that Raymundo
Ride it like a skateboard going hard off this Rocket Power
Now this is only for family
Take your girl bring her back Friday like Stanley
The best french man but you will not can me
Racks on racks so you cannot band me

She just make a phone call and get some new dough
(BRRR-BRRR)
Bitch nigga, that's new clothes!
Sneak in a girl dorm, hide in her clothes
She from the step team, you know I'm into those
Work her booty here, there ain't nothing silicone
Give her the vitamins, but she don't get minerals

All my girls stepping, repping sororities
Tell that girl you don't rep more than me
Tell that nigga you don't rep more than me!

But your ex not in here
My momma, I ain't for the drama
From the seb, no beef, we're just tryna' get the commas




My niggas pull off in this whip
Full speed to my after-hours
Take a couple more sips

She came through stunting, red-hair ruckus
And she don't do the black, I thank her Uncle Ruckus
She got hella back and she don't get her friend
She love attention, thirsty niggas always in the sun
She hold up that sign to let a nigga know
She don't do broke -- rich niggas, new coach
She just make a phone call and get some new dough
(BRRR-BRRR)
Bitch nigga, that's new clothes!
Sneak in a girl dorm, hide in her clothes
She from the step team, you know I'm into those
Work her booty here, there ain't nothing silicone
Give her the vitamins, but she don't get minerals
All my niggas stepping, repping fraternities
All my girls stepping, repping sororities
Tell that girl you don't rep more than me
Tell that nigga you don't rep more than me!

Them ho niggas ordered Victoria Secret cards
Finger your mom with a aged thumb
Money talk so I say sum'n, play sum'n
Why every time I do a feature, it feel like I ate sum'n?
Real shit, got the A locked
With my rollie on the west coast, call it bay watch, nigga
They watch, nigga,put it in a safe box, nigga
Put a fucking dread lock in her, hey!
Throw this money, the trap my habitat
Woke up with money, cause I went to sleep with racks,real shit




This is why you know I'm the man
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
You say you hot but you ain't buzzing like a lava lamp
Breaking hoes hearts in my B-Boy stance
Making this money Bye-Bye like the N-Sync dance
I be running in your mama like it's my last steps
And I'ma balling ass nigga bank with MaxPreps
Ooh yeah, I'm from Seven oh Seven
Used to be on Pintail from the 7-Eleven
You know she hold it down for a mac
She make it jump like I'm holding on an iPhone app
Like holla,give her that Raymundo
Ride it like a skateboard going hard off this Rocket Power
Now this is only for family
Take your girl bring her back Friday like Stanley
The best french man but you will not can me
Racks on racks so you cannot band me



[Hook]

Don't stop go crazy x4
Yeah[Outro]
[Verse 1: D-Mac]
Get it get it get it get it
She popping and dropping it
Only dancing for that poffer
Shake it faster than an ostrich
Ill rock it sock it bop it
Bend it over I'mma show you how a real nigga gon' do
Beat it down like a rumble when im done make you stumble
Then we go crazy let me see them hips twirl
Put you on my shoulders do some shit to make your toes curl
Earthquake drill cause im gonna rock your world
Had her tapping out legs shaking like a snow globe
Had her on them crutches
Causing up a ruckus
Call me hammer time cause my style
You can't touch this
Want to make music
Blow blow me like a trumpet
Her sister hold her hand so she backed it up and dumped it
She a bad little yomper
Booty soft like some pampers on my lap
Like im finna beat it up
Come pretender
On the pole like a stripper
Shake it fast off the Richter
Bend that ass over throw it at me like a pitcherD-mac!




Uh uh owa
[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
[Verse 2: Show Banga]
Drop it down on a man panoramic owa
Im a ramic owa

Finna fuck up the game I'mma spam it owa
And dig i read all of my tricks
When you leave your girl around
Then she is gonna get freaked
Now i got her at the crib
Showing me how she freak
I robbed more at the peak
She a cold by the shnick
Freak of the week
Freak of the lick
You know i get it wet

Face down ass up
Now show me them cheeks
Move it around do it just like a stripper
And now i want to dance
I want to put down my zipper
If i sip a little liquor
I might just lick her
If i get her backstage
Then you know I'mma stick her
And know i...

[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
[Hook: Sage the Gemini]
I look at the bigger picture
I walk around my hood and take pictures
Pockets bigger
Puttin' on for my hood for these niggas
But they be hatin' on a nigga
Yeah, yeah, they be hatin' on a nigga
Yeah, I like that



Doing these interviews, saying where my heart is
I'm from Fairfield and niggas still mock me the hardest
Just because I can't help you niggas be artists
And got the nerve to tell me don't forget where I started
I know where I started nigga thats the bottom
Tryna buy equipment where money was the problem
I can outsmart em'
Me and my brother Cadence
Both thirteen tryna clean nigga's places
Just to buy our first microphone at Gordon's
Around this time you niggas
Wouldn't think to record shit
Sage wasn't important, I don't know you niggas
Remember I used to say, "I'ma show you niggas"
MTV, a few songs on the billboards
You niggas still at home hangin' out with your real boys
And I'm the man, you niggas are still boys
And I'm big on niggas ears like keloids





I got a few wins under a young nigga's belt
I understand you feel like I'm the easiest help
I'm trying to own the whole house listen to me well
Because sometimes your foot in the door just don't help
I can't help you if I'm tryna help myself
Get off my chest I can't invest with no wealth
Like I said, most of yall' wasn't there when I started
Might of made it, but on paper I'm still a new artist
The reason I got a name from when it was dry, or it pouring
I was tryna make beats past four in the mornin'
Not under bitches who be drinking and smokin'
But under the PC, hella' slow when it's loadin'
The message for you niggas, when I'm done and they're homeless
Don't be hatin' when I can't help put you on
Strive for the spot till the struggle is gone
But even then, work harder until the struggle is foreign
Hah




What's happening though, man?
My nigga S-A-G motherfucking E
This your bro Shady Bo nigga
Ain't out there right now to see you shine bruh but you good
I'll be free soon. I See you doing your thing, lil bruh

As long as you stick nigga, Yeah nigga 15 nigga, 16 nigga

Legs spread open like a chicken wing (40!)


Me and my niggas all up in the function, gettin' turnt up
