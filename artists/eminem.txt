[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing,cause all I wanted to do's be
The Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep
One sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm...



[Bridge: Rihanna] X2
[Hook]
Well, that's nothing


[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head,keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...




[Hook + Bridge]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm
Coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and I'll
Take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that,pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and
Relates, that's great,it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can
Make that,straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

[Hook + Bridge]
[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?


[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down,the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope,he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home,that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


[Hook x2]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo


[Verse 2]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada.And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer,this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot,another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point,I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot,or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got




[Hook]
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man[Produced by DVLP]

[Intro]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)


[Verse 1]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me  rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap
Packin' a mack in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)


[Verse 2]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC
And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game,'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-lookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for
Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace, looking boy


[Verse 3]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin,you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya,like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock,shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky,pill junky
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek,fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes]

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)


[Verse 2]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew,nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it?Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you,the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch,man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung,like you picked an axe up and swung,stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now,wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan,Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again



[Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner]

[Verse 4]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult,batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back,before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all,tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable,here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off[Produced by DVLP]

Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock,shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky,pill junky
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek,fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up and
Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah


[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


[Verse 1]
I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far,"Cleaning Out My Closet"
And all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you
Cause ma, you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be too calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to Chemical Warfare and forever we could drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
Don't mean shit to me, you're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and
It's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave," ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats,why we always at each others throats
'specially when dad, he fucked us both, we're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that'd make us close,further away it drove us, but together
Headlights shine, and a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried
The weight of the load, then Nate got taken away by the state at 8-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but...




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleaning Out My Closet," at the time I was angry
Rightfully, maybe so, never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry
The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up
In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back and
I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess
I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my momma



[Hook]

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Hook]
[Hook: Dido]

[Verse 1]
Dear Slim,I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man,how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her, I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too,that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan,this is Stan



[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote; I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my Mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it ?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out



[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn[Produced by Scoop DeVille]

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my lord,lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash,or get yourkicked, pow!
Frown while I shit on your crown,skip town
Grounds zero, shapiro the king cash cow
Do I make 'em say 'Wow!',strip, ow, bow
I sit with the pound,click, pow
Blow, click, click, pow, click, pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start when I growl
(rawr, rawr, rawr)let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off I never stop, cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see me cop raw
And if you ain’t have enough
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal Fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
Back with the B.A barrackus callous,bang on another song I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
And I shit on these males ‘til it's stinkin' fouler than a weed smell
Nigga your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming a email
Talking,I’m sick and I got them shook and I bang em at retail
Until they cripple,see I cook like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
Oh see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
The case is shut
Your bitch remind me of my replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
It's going down like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attack them like apes in the cut
I’m waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet, fuck
It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted harassing and erase a nigga (crunk)keeping 'em over
Keeping 'em up and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
I got ‘em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck these funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up like boots when I’m pushing they face in the mud (ahh)
Missiles I fling while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt the break a brick surfacing back a sound
While I'm lighting up shit that'll cause quick
Worship and gather around, it's
Certain this shit'll splatter cliques painful and make ‘em scatter
Shameful the way I shatter, split shit apart, it doesn't matter (rip)
Your head up off your shoulders (with) bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know us, classic
And the way it’s going you could easily get your ass kicked
See, me and Shady together we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and a rabies cake like a pastry bitch
(We that sick)
Like I'm from Haiti, I’m suggesting you pay me
Don’t make me wanna spazz (Alalala)
Like I’m a crazy Israeli, bastards
While I bite the beat up and I'm starting to heat up, yack
I’m chopping your foot off, now it’s mine
And I’m putting my feet up, black
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
Naw, but the beat is fried!



[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick
So irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit
Narrow minded,but go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Davis' driveway
With his personal memoir saying he's bi
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry "rape"then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade, yippee-Ki-Yay
Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign? Maybe to take 'em back into time (Shady)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger
To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking
An inkling of replacing the kingpin
Of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen and
Who raps nasally, eyes hazelly, rhymes crazily
But sounds like he may need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
See me on a ballot? I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just a candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am eight
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president, ho
Don't make me go take it back to the days of old
Where Sway &amp; Tech radio when I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the wake up show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets dawg,fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
Everything, I'm an expert on everything, everything sucks, play the next song"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God I'm the S.O.G. like a wet log, pores never get clogged
I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
Yes, yes y’all, steady on the left, y’all
Step off 'forr you get stepped on, soft?
Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
Alert, alert, girl, alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt, so
Jump around, jump, jump, get that ass shaking
Jump around, jump,came to hit you with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms and freaking hands flailing
And jump like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy


[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing,cause all I wanted to do's be
The Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep
One sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm...



[Bridge: Rihanna] X2
[Hook]
Well, that's nothing


[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head,keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...




[Hook + Bridge]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm
Coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and I'll
Take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that,pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and
Relates, that's great,it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can
Make that,straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

[Hook + Bridge]
[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?


[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down,the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope,he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home,that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


[Hook x2]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo


[Verse 2]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada.And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer,this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot,another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point,I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot,or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got




[Hook]
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up and
Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah


[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far


[Verse 1]
I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far,"Cleaning Out My Closet"
And all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you
Cause ma, you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be too calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to Chemical Warfare and forever we could drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
Don't mean shit to me, you're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and
It's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave," ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats,why we always at each others throats
'specially when dad, he fucked us both, we're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that'd make us close,further away it drove us, but together
Headlights shine, and a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried
The weight of the load, then Nate got taken away by the state at 8-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but...




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleaning Out My Closet," at the time I was angry
Rightfully, maybe so, never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry
The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up
In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back and
I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess
I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my momma



[Hook]

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Hook]
[Hook: Dido]

[Verse 1]
Dear Slim,I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man,how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her, I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too,that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan,this is Stan



[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote; I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my Mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it ?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out



[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes]

[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)


[Verse 2]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew,nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it?Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you,the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch,man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung,like you picked an axe up and swung,stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now,wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan,Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again



[Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner]

[Verse 4]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult,batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back,before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all,tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable,here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off[Empty Section]

How the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life


[Verse 1]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain,bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it:I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress: fucking baggy sweats,go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left,I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept,it's unfortunate but it's




[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap,don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out,I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this,I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama,I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess,cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...

[Hook]

I'm a tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, specially when you wrote ninety percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'fore you come up missin' like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of shit? bitch be sure that I'm spittin'
Be hittin', you gonna pray to god this shit was written
But it wasn't I'll kill a dozen rappers when I buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now whos ya boy?bitch you about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladamir Konstastinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'm a do some written shit, plus I get to go last
Well guess what ? even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo verse
I'm bout to slice you like a ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take you fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start taking your period out on me

Time of the month, you couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I ripped him like a paper mache
I've heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush, I don't give a fuck
Ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin back with pimp shit
I'll laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the rap olympics

I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style's just one Big Syke
Take a big hike, bitch you can't catch me

That will wear a fake ass corduroy

Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn, all you white jokes just backfired

Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit,pause,inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous,I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming,fuck is you saying?


[Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes,all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu,this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing,fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date,you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't , I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants,and the first one who pees gets a black eye


[Hook: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind, you think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over


[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me?I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa,you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight


[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers,cesspoolers,meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugersto respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock




[Hook]
[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers,I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors,I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong,get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand)Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong,my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads,I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart


[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver,getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk,my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin,but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging,it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch,I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89,no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile,the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy game over

Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again

Game over![Eminem]
[Yelawolf]
[Hook- Skam (Eminem)]
Yo, I'm trying to be the man of the day, three six five a year
See the bullshit you saying, Skam ain't trying to hear (Fuck that!)
Busting lyrics in the air, keeping some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doing?) Man, I'm releasing anger!
(I'm trying to be the illest of the day, three six five a year
See that bullshit you saying, Shady ain't trying to hear
Spitting lyrics in your ear,keeping some up in the chamber)
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doing? (I'm releasing anger!)


[Skam]
Man I'm tired of being tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of being late for the bus
Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doing?)




[Hook]
[Bridge]
"I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns &amp; Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
"Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am"?"


[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

[Hook]
[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless,patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind,you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now


[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella,worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpetsand burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with


Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the[Verse 3]
40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur,walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure![Hook]
Now what you know about a sweet MC,from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus; my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke,can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate,yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know




[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will will be sealed your casket closed you still will be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MC's and I'mma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

[Hook]
[Intro]
There is no escaping, there's no place to hide
You scream someone save me, but they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye


[Verse 1]
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea,he just saw ya run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again,swallowing a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn,holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it,wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again,not again


[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the morning,put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em


[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube,maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again,brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me,what am I gon' do? Hey,the prodigal son
The diabolical one,very methodical when I slaughter them




[Hook]
[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again


[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
My last Vic and a half,a fleshlight of Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me;that might be an artery, son
Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none,he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up

[Hook]

Yo, yo, yo!
[Verse 4]
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)[Shabaam Shadeeq]
Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them jive turkey mc's
Say what you like, I toss
Your theory when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary
Mic brutality,switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka
Fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
They know the time like a sun-dial
I'm X-File


[Eminem]
Went to bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
Fuck hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born, I was hatched
And dumped in the trash with a note attached
Sayin' someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out cause the tires suck
Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
You better run cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded, I miss my sanity since the night we departed


[Skam]
Yo Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control then to be under it
Yo how you gonna win against us when we got nothin to lose
Must be confused
Or prayin to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your bible-kissin asses even if he did
We like to twist ya mystic, genetic dead-end
Don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language
Say my name in Spanish
That's "Chupacabra", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that makes the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."


When it comes to beef
I gets relief when I kill and breathe
[A.L.]
Send a wreathe get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock ya teeth
Take ya seat like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em
Down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin so much
I need some penecilin
Jams I'm spillin cause I'm bound here
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown is RIP cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin you're brave ya'll
You're in a graveyard
One in a mil' son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin, in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish
I'll speak in English while your brothers are speakin in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice
When they play the dice
I'll take you life, slay you twice
Before you break your rights


Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin this without the benefits of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple
You banned from usin writin utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact

Send them wack men back to the lab
Where most of them laugh
I can hand you a manual to make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see
Which animals eat amphibians from spittin up that written stuff
It’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest no hits of chronic in mi bionic
I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup em
Fuck em, bless em through, what[Rabbit]
Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid
My technique is bizarre and ill;
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That’s all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz’s
I lead the new school
You a BUSTA without the RHYMES
I crush the shit out your lines[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!


[Eminem]
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport anymore
When you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic
Cause I'm telling you right now you're not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof- are you with me?


Come on then, everybody come on and
[Hook: Eminem]
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers,come on IN
Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning


[Swifty]
They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs,I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popping slugs, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses;a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like it's Seasons Greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing frequent
You niggas need an E just to speak shit
And your heateris a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it and won't even keep it a secret
Nigga, I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?




[Hook]
[Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us but so what,this beef is like what the fuck
Did he say in his rap?Em, I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me pleased when seeing guts
I don't need no enemies cause my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing the mic, they empty out on them bike
To fight you in front of everyone important that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say, "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
WHAT! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
You'll leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!


[Kuniva]
I walk with a limp,pistolhanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys,but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped
Outta your stomach, and when they want it
I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin if you coming

[Hook]
[Empty Section]
Verse 1:
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you,this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally,but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink,my pussy does it stink
He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch,he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt,deceitful witch
You thought you had me,'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

Verse 2:
I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river I shiver
When I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together,when we slept together every-thing
Was all better ,she made me feel like a king
Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla"
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots,wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller,and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do, call her out on it,we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this

Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white,sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da,it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it,my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


[Hook]
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


[Eminem]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap,gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan,momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step,don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man , I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin'this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own,I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




[Hook]
[Eminem]
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance,a certificate
Of authenticity,you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned,havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one,the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot,sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow,my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now,I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Hook]
[Verse 1: Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu,what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?)

(Chorus)


[Verse 2: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is, turnin to yellow with orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis,too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started
Cock block your fathers game
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'mma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out

(Chorus)[Jay-Z]
Yeah,Renegade is back
Em the beat is sick
It's Young, Freeway,8 Miles, let's go

8 miles and running,got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album coming,feeding a thousand growling stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothing
People said I would amount to nothing, that I had talent for nothing
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had coming"
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smiling
Wanting something, claiming that they done something for him
Got their Jay-Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
Claimin' they been running and telling everybody like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suing us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suiting up
Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us


8 miles and running, got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free

6 miles and running, got my fifth strip popping
[Hook: Jay-Z]
[Freeway]
And my first album coming, feeding twenty growling stomachs

8 miles and running, got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album coming, feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free

6 miles and running, got my fifth strip popping
And my first album coming, feeding twenty growling stomachs


6 miles and running in the[Jay-Z]
[Freeway]
[Freeway]
Pontiac
Six thousand eighty six, trans might shift while the engine run
Now tell ya riders give me one more chance
And them smokers screaming, "One more gram"
So I'mma bring 'em one
Only son to my pop, stick close to my momma
Keep toasters for drama,make Salat with my son
My son growing and he learning a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop, brain on ya um-
Brella a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the Biblical scripture
Look back, turn to salt like the sinners
Most of ya heartless and self-centered like Meshach and Mesha
Set up ya brother cuz you jealous, nigga
The heat back, like you never left
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Six miles and running dodging every trap
The rap gingerbread man, cheer us
Every precious breath, State P the second gat




Back when nobody would find he had talent, nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy blindly
[Hook]
[Jay-Z]
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothin' but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm takin' all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illest,Free is the future
Beans and Bleekis right now, we can see y'all 8 miles nigga

[Hook]
[Intro - Eminem]
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!


[Verse - Eminem]
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans,they knowing when D-Bo was
50,Tweezy,Obie there won't be no ho in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off


Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911


Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
[Hook - Eminem]
[Verse - B-Real]
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon


About to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
[Hook]
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911

Verse - [Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

About to change, cause we ain't playing no games

Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'mma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you


[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way,she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?


Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I!


[Hook]
[Verse 2]
See honey: there's a place called "heaven" and a place called "hell"
A place called "prison" and a place called "jail"
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya?
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter



[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sleepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming in her ear(ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of three
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)

There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk


Just me and you baby
Is all we need in this world
Just me and you
[Outro]
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that: if you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you, baby[Empty Section]

Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cyphersmoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook

Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager

Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her

Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me

Put up some extra fences

Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry

I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
