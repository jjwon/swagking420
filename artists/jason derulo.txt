(Hook)

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yet the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go
And the trumpets they go
Yeah the trumpets they go

Da da, da ra ra da, da, da
Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da
Da da, da ra ra da, da, da
Da, ra, ra, ra, da, da

Is it weird that I hear
Violins whenever you’re gone
Is it weird that your ass
Remind me of a Kanye West song?

Angels every time that you moan?

Hey, I know this shit might sound crazy
Before you get in bed, throw on those
Hey girl, now I know why you waited
Had to be sure that I was worth the thrill
Ladies come and go but you got something different
Had me sofrom the start
And I'd never known all this loving I'd be missing
If I didn't work my way into your heart


You give me,[Hook]
vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo

You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you
Like your birthday suit
You give me vertigo, that vertigo


The way that you please me sets this room on fire
I'm burning with desire in this bed
So if I'm dreaming please don't wake me up
If all of this is happening in my head
Waited for so long
But what you got is different
Had me so addicted from the start
Boy, I'd never known the shit that I was missing
If I hadn't worked my way into your heart


You give me vertigo, vertigo
The bed, the floor, the kitchen
Don't really matter long as I get
Vertigo, vertigo
I'm tucked, all bottled inside
You're a bad baby, you're making me sweat
Tell me that it's cool that I'm stuck on you

You give me vertigo, that vertigo


I'm working downtown

This love that we found
We'll never regret
Was empty inside

You waking me up

We stay here all day
And my head be spinning
You do it to me with our vertigo


You give me vertigo, vertigo

Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do


[Pre-Hook]
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough


[Hook]
I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing

Thought me and you together would end up on top,you
Changed me for better, for worse

Never once thought you would be this trifling
But oh I was blinded


[Pre-Hook]]
I was like (oh oh oh)
Never wanna let you (go go go)
I was open before (I was open before)
But now I know


That love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind, your love made me blind
Your love made me blind, your love made me blind


I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking to much but
I'm good, glad that I know now
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has its reasons
Every smile has its own season
Never once thought you'd be this trifling
But oh I was blinded...






Cause when I felt your lips pressed against mine
Though the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
I Love the way you scream my name

I only miss you when I'm breathing

This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me
I will be waiting here for you til the end

I only miss you when I'm breathing

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

I only miss you when I'm breathing

I wanna see pictures of you leaning
On these four
Walls, and on the ceiling
Gave you a kiss, but I'm dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug, I am needing
Paradise that I'm so seeking
I'm still alive, hope there's a reason

Can't move my lips, but my heart's screaming

I only miss you when I'm breathing
I only miss you when I'm breathing

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

I only miss you when I'm breathing

Oh baby, I only miss you when I
I'm screaming out your name, but you don't answer me
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy?
I sound the alarm, tell everyone that I only miss you

I only miss you when I'm breathing

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

When I think of all the years I want to be with you
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
That's precisely what I plan to do


[Pre-Hook]
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
Buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
We'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough


[Hook]
I'll say will you marry me
I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me

The more I look, the more I find the reasons why
You're the love of my life

And if I lost everything
In my heart it means nothing
Cause I have you, girl I have you

I swear that I will mean it
I'll say will you marry me (Yeah)

Do a pop song and stack my Caucasians!

Looking in the mirror
Looking in the mirror
My own reflection
Can't stand to look into my eyes
It's been eating me up
The things we're hiding
I'm so done with those lies

(Verse)
Now I've cheated, I've miss-leaded, baby oh oh
Forgot your birthday, it was on Thursday, I am so oh
By the time you got you cryin but you know
I'm only human

(Pre-Hook 1)
I did some things that I can't erase
I'm not looking for no one to blame
Think it's time I've told you everything
I'm not who you think
(Hook)
Now you know who I really am
Now you know where I've been
I'm only hoping that you'll understand
Sometimes I make...
Mistakes
Mistakes
Mistakes
Sometimes I make mistakes

(Verse)
I'm so possessive, overprotecting
Wanna know who what and where
It's cause I love you
But maybe too much
But I'm only human

(Pre-Hook 2)
Now you know what you don't see
Only comes from insecurity
I'm not perfect and I'll never be
I'm not who you think

Now you know who I really am
Now you know where I've been
I'm only hoping that you'll understand
Sometimes I make...

Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it


I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)


All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time but
I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart is so cold to the point that my blood it froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby, you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex I'm sorry


I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)


I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all

Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is Gods plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster I'm sorry


I've had all the women you could possibly

In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (you live and you learn girl)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This the struggle)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (from nothing to something)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This all I know)


I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

Done some wrong and some right
Derulo, Pitbull, this how we do


I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)[Jason Derulo]

[Verse 1]
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gonna have to make a choice
Should he keep up with the player's life
Or listen to that inner voice
Saying if you got a good one
You'd be a fool if you let it go
I admit the other days were fun
But I think it's time for me to grow


There ain't no one in this entire world
I'd rather be with than you girl


So I'm throwin' out all my cards
Cuz I think I've finally found the
Queen of Hearts (Queen of Hearts)
Queen of Hearts (Queen of Hearts)
I used to be the King of Clubs
But now those days are done
Oh, cause I know you are (know you are)
The Queen of Hearts (Queen of Hearts)
Queen of Hearts (Queen of Hearts)
You're my Queen of Hearts


Well I knew this day was gonna come
When I would have to shuffle my plans
Now I got a pair of diamonds
So I put them in your hands, yeah
Cause you are the real thing
There's no way I could walk away
I'm givin you the best of me
So baby you wanna dance?






No one before you came close to what you do
You know that's the truth for sure
You changed my life now I can't see me without your love
So I'm betting on us

I met her at a bar
The look she gave me said I wouldn't get far
But that ain't never stop me
See I like a challenge so I proceeded to speak
One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover
Love hangover, love hangover

Don't you worry it's fine
See this will be our little dirty secret for life
Cause your man will lose his mind
If he ever found out last night

One drink turned into two drinks
Three drinks turned into dancing
And pretty soon her body was all upon me
When I woke up I saw her laying next to me

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover

Now I didn't know
How far it'll go
But I said I would have her
Now it's the morning after

It was just a fling
But I really don't regret a thing
Cause it was crazy babe
And by the looks of it you feel the same
And all I remember is me saying
Give it to me then you came in
Now I'm smiling and I'm barely sober
I'm caught in a love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
I'm caught in love hangover
Love hangover..[Empty Section]
